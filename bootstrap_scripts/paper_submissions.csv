Gaze-based graphical passwords are a particularly promising means for shoulder-surfing-resistant authentication, but selecting secure passwords remains challenging. In this paper, we present a novel gaze-based authentication scheme that makes use of cued-recall graphical passwords on a single image. In order to increase password security, our approach uses a computational model of visual attention to mask those areas of the image that are most likely to attract visual attention. We create a realistic threat model for attacks that may occur in public settings, such as filming the user's interaction while drawing money from an ATM. Based on a 12-participant user study, we show that our approach is significantly more secure than a standard image-based authentication and gaze-based 4-digit PIN entry.","1. Angeli, A.

In a quantitative study, we compared audience retention and macrostructure understanding of slide deck vs. canvas presentations. We found both approaches to be equally capable of communicating information to the audience.

In a preliminary study, we identified five holds that permit simultaneous support and interaction, and noted that users frequently change position to combat fatigue. We then designed the BiTouch design space, which introduces a support function in the kinematic chain model for interacting with hand-held tablets, and developed BiPad, a toolkit for creating bimanual tablet interaction with the thumb or the fingers of the supporting hand. We ran a controlled experiment to explore how tablet orientation and hand position affect three novel techniques: bimanual taps, gestures and chords. Bimanual taps outperformed our one-handed control condition in both landscape and portrait orientations; bimanual chords and gestures in portrait mode only; and thumbs outperformed fingers, but were more tiring and less stable. Together, BiTouch and BiPad offer new opportunities for designing bimanual interaction on hand-held tablets.","1. Balakrishnan, R., and Hinckley, K.

Participants in face-to-face interactions have many cues to each other's affect, but work is increasingly carried out via computer-mediated channels that lack many of these cues. Current presence systems enable users to estimate the availability of other users, but not their affective states or communication preferences. This work demonstrates the feasibility of estimating affective state and communication preferences from a stream of presence states that are already being shared in a deployed presence system.","1.

We report the findings of a laboratory experiment investigating the effects of increased interruption workload demand on older adults' computerised cognitive test performance. Related work has reported interruptions having a range of inhibitory and facilitatory effects on primary task performance. Cognitive ageing literature suggests that increased interruption workload demand should have greater detrimental effects on older adults' performance, when compared to younger adults. With 36 participants from 3 age groups (20-54, 55-69, 70+), we found divergent effects of increased interruption demand on two primary tasks. Results suggest that older and younger adults experience interruptions differently, but at no age is test performance compromised by demanding interruptions. This finding is reassuring with respect to the success of a self-administered computerised cognitive assessment test, and is likely to be useful for other applications used by older adults.","1.

We draw attention to the fact that C-TOC primary tasks are open-ended, allowing for partially correct solutions, unlike the primary tasks in related work of interruptions and older adults [5,11]. \ -In INTRODUCTION (para 6) we now explicitly state that ""we did not include individuals with diagnosed cognitive impairments, as the effects of interruption must be gauged first when cognition is not impaired."" We are now replicating this study's methodology with different clinical groups (see CONCLUSION, final para). \ -Re: education levels of participants, we mention that MOCA and NAART screening scores were comparable between participants in the three groups (Procedure, para 1) \ -We have added a short description of experiment setting to Procedure, para 1 \ -In Coordination of Primary and Interrupting Tasks, we refer to the first author's thesis, and in particular to a figure that explains the timeline and coordination of primary and interrupting tasks. \  \ In addition to the above, we address several additional concerns mentioned by the AC: \ -Re: why an equal number of verbal and spatial tasks were not used, we emphasise in Procedure that this difference is consistent with the design of C-TOC. \ -Rationale for the 2s interruption lag is given in the form of an example provided by [27], see Predicting the COI: Interruption lag \ -The usage of 'old' and 'older' has been made more consistent. When referring to study participants in the 70+ group, 'OLD' in small-caps is used.

However, since it can only sense hand position but not hand orientation robustly, current mid-air interaction methods for 3D virtual object manipulation often require contextual and mode switching to perform translation, rotation, and scaling, thus preventing natural continuous gestural interactions. A novel handle bar metaphor is proposed as an effective visual control metaphor between the user's hand gestures and the corresponding virtual object manipulation operations. It mimics a familiar situation of handling objects that are skewered with a bimanual handle bar. The use of relative 3D motion of the two hands to design the mid-air interaction allows us to provide precise controllability despite the Kinect sensor's low image resolution. A comprehensive repertoire of 3D manipulation operations is proposed to manipulate single objects, perform fast constrained rotation, and pack/align multiple objects along a line. Three user studies were devised to demonstrate the efficacy and intuitiveness of the proposed interaction techniques on different virtual manipulation scenarios.","1.

Using such temporal structures to convey information can be particularly useful in situations where the visual channel is overloaded or even not available. In this paper we introduce Rhythmic Interaction as the use of rhythms for input. We report the results of two experiments that show that (i) rhythmic patterns can be efficiently reproduced by novice users and recognized by computer algorithms, and (ii) rhythmic patterns can be memorized as efficiently as traditional shortcuts when associating them with visual commands. Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of Rhythmic Interaction and open the way to a richer repertoire of interaction techniques.","1. Appert, C., and Zhai, S.

Most studies of this approach employ predefined tasks to ensure that users experience specific aspects of the system, whereas other studies use no task assignments. Yet the effect of using predefined tasks is still to be uncovered. There is also limited research on instructions for users in identifying usability problems. This paper reports from a comparative study of the effect of task assignments and instruction types on the problems identified in remote asynchronous usability testing of a website for information retrieval, involving 53 prospective users. The results show that users solving predefined tasks identified significantly more usability problems with a significantly higher level of agreement than those working on their own authentic tasks. Moreover, users that were instructed by means of examples of usability problems identified significantly more usability problems than those who received a conceptual definition of usability problems. \ ","1.

The literature on remote usability generally uses 'testing', so we have used that consistently throughout the paper. \  \  \ Abstract \  \ R4: In the abstract, you say, ""...it is still unresolved whether users should work on their own tasks or a set that is predefined by the evaluators."" I strongly suspect this is a bit of a false dichotomy. The results of your study clearly show the superiority of using a common task. \  \ R1: This paper makes little contribution to the field of HCI: it approached an important area (that of remote asynchronous usability testing) in a very traditional way, with no substantial addition to pre-existing research. \  \ R4: The reviewers all agree that this paper addresses an important topic.  R1 felt that there was too little contribution here and suggested greater clarity with respect to terminology, research questions and writing in general. R2 and R3 really liked this paper. \  \ R4: I think this paper makes a significant contribution. \  \ Author response: We have rewritten the Abstract to clarify the results and the contribution.  \  \  \ Introduction, Contribution and Research Question \  \ R4: This paper reviews some of the literature on remote usability testing and then presents a study to examine the effects of instruction set and task choice type on the value of the returned results.  \ R2: The paper describes a study evaluating the effect of different instruction types and task assignments on asynchronous remote usability evaluations.  \  \ R3: The paper reports a study of the effects of task instructions and types of reporting instructions on problem yields in user testing, with a control LAB group alongside remote testing groups. Significant effects are found for fixed task instructions and for inductive instructions. \  \ R2: I think the authors did a very good and careful job on analysing the different concepts involved (very clearly described), on describing the state of the art, and in the design of their study. \  \ R1: There is no clear, important research question. It starts with whether to have the user execute its own set of tasks or a pre-defined set, and then changes a bit towards the type of instructions to be given. \  \ Author response: There is considerable disagreement between the reviewers on this. We accept that the contribution could be clarified. Thus we have rewritten the abstract (see above) and re-phrased the research question (the first sentence in the last paragraph of the Introduction). \  \  \ Related Work \  \ R4: I thought the review section was well-written and provided good background and motivation. \  \  \ Method \  \ R1: The benchmark stablished for validation is a controlled lab evaluation (using techniques, such as the Think-Aloud protocol that cannot be replicated in the remote testing, for example). \  \ R1: Devise a benchmark that is more akin to the research procedure. \  \ Author response: We see the point in the comment from R1. Yet we have used a benchmark that is commonly used in usability testing research. We have added a comment to clarify that. \  \  \ R1: There is no clear cut between the categories tasks/no tasks vs. type of instruction - a clearer explanation and use of all the possible combinations should be presented. \  \ Author response: We would like to be more explicit about this. However, we find that this is already done in Table 2 and the related text. \  \  \ R4: R2 suggested that you add more detail about the website chosen, pointing out that there are many sources of such sites and they differ a lot in terms of quality.  \  \ R2: A bit more information about the web site used. In my university such a site about ""study regulations, exams, study board members, contact information, campus maps etc."" is huge and has really nice parts usability-wise and absolutely diabolic ones as well. They come from different sources (admin, computer science teachers, student groups etc.) and a weakness of the studay could be that some subjects might not have even seen relevant parts which are nice or ugly. They could have seen very different sections - what would be the effect on the statistics there? \  \ Author response: We have added more information about the website in the Method section, and we have emphasized as a limitation (in the Conclusion section) that some of our test users may have seen different parts of the website. \  \  \ R1: The analysed results were of those respondents who cleared performed the task: there is no knowledge of whether a task was attempted, but no report of problems was generated, for example. This procedure might have skewed the results a bit. \  \ R2: Also, I was astonished that the 9-task-subjects which were given tasks (T), solved 3.8 tasks only - did they not try all the 9 ones? Maybe this is a question of wording? \  \ Author response: We agree that it would have been interesting to collect information regarding the number of tasks attempted solved within the non-task based conditions. We have added this as a limitation and a topic for future work. \  \  \ Results and Discussion \  \ R2: I disliked the large part with statistical analysis, but this seems to be CHI-typical these days (years). I am content with the results and discussion sections. \  \ Author response: We have tried only to provide statistical analysis of data that clearly contribute to answer our research question, and we have explained and commented on the statistical results. Apart from that, this is probably also a matter of taste. \  \  \ R4: I also liked the results and discussion.   On page 7, column two, you report, ""Furthermore, we see a significant difference between the LAB-DN/NT and LAB-DIN/DIT conditions (p<0.1).""   Typically people use a more rigid criterion for significance (.05 or .01).Not sure whether this is a typo. Furthermore, as you do elsewhere in the paper, you should include the degrees of freedom, the test, and the actual number for the test. \  \ Author response: We have corrected the indicated typo and added degrees of freedom.  \  \  \ R3: I was surprised to see [8] in the references (it's about Heuristic Evaluation), and it's not cited. To leave this in, you'd need to mention that the 2 expert evaluators with even a loose directive on tasks (copying diagrams from text books) found problems that the 90+ students in groups did not.  Alternatively, strengthen [17] with a further reference on the impact of structured report formats in follow on research from [8]. \  \ Author response: The inclusion of [8] in the references was an error, and it has been removed. \  \  \ Conclusion and Limitations \  \ R3: This is a textbook experimental design that has been well executed and provides useful results for the planning of remote user tests. \ R3: It has value for research and practice and I see no reason why not to accept it. \  \ R2: The results are practically usable and will interest not few (while still not that many) CHI attendees - the ones involved in practical usability work. This applies even if this is not in REMOTE Usability Evaluation. \  \ R3: It may seem somewhat dated in focus and interest, but if First Wave HCI had studied evaluation practices properly, we would not need to be doing such studies alongside Third Wave HCI. \  \ R3: This is an excellent example of a study that looks inside methods at the impact of resource variations (i.e., task description presence/absence, instructions to remote users) instead of foolishly attempting to compare methods.  More could be made of [17] here as an example of the impact of resource variation on evaluation performance to indicate that this research mirrors a recent trend in focusing within methods on resources to assess the impact of resource variations. \  \ Author response: We appreciate these remarks. We have added a comment about the nature of this study as noted in the last remark from R3, and emphasized that we see this study as being relevant to practice as well. \  \  \ R4: I do feel that you may be overstating the generality of the conclusion however. In the abstract, you say, ""...it is still unresolved whether users should work on their own tasks or a set that is predefined by the evaluators."" I strongly suspect this is a bit of a false dichotomy. The results of your study clearly show the superiority of using a common task.  Indeed, this would be my predeliction where this is feasible.  HOWEVER, there may be cases where this is nonetheless not the preferred method.For instance, imagine testing that must be done with very busy and highly paid professionals such as medical doctors or CIA analysts who are using a system aimed at helping them solve complex, real-world problems.  They will probably not have the patience for taking the time to do a long, complex and arbitrary task.  On the other hand, if one were designing a website for consumers who want to do on-line buying, your results would be quite apropos.  You do mention in the conclusion that the correct ""answer"" might be different for different websites, but it also might be quite different for different types of users.  \  \ R1: I failed to extract, from the procedure and data presented how the overall conclusions (more tasks = more reported problesm; less task = more variability) - although they seem to be fairly expected. \  \ Author response: These are relevant points. We have rewritten the Conclusion to state this more clearly. \  \  \ R1: The paper claims to have performed ecological validity, but presents a mere simulation. No study ""in the wild"" was performed. \  \ Author response: There is no claim anywhere in the paper about ecological validity. The concept was used in the Introduction to describe the problem with task assignments. However, the concept is not important, so we have removed it to avoid confusion and we have emphasized more clearly the limitations of the study. \  \  \ Details \  \ R3: \ p3 col1 bottom paragraph, suggested rewording The research reviewed above primarily comprises feasibility ... \ p4 col 3, missing because, incorrect plural & tense? This was done [because] a previous studied had described \ p6. col 2 Missing Figure 2 reference \  \ Author response: We have made the suggested changes.","","engineering","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 22 08:53",""

'Envisioning', a characteristic future-oriented technique for design thinking, often features as significant part of our research processes in the field. This paper compares, contrasts and critiques the varied ways in which envisionings have been used within ubiquitous computing and traces their relationships to other, different envisionings, such as those of virtual reality. In unpacking envisioning, it argues primarily that envisioning should be foregrounded as a significant concern and interest within HCI. Foregrounding envisioning's frequent mix of fiction, forecasting and extrapolation, the paper recommends changes in the way we read, interpret and use envisionings through taking into account issues such as context and intended audience.","1.

Our results show that regardless of the relationship situation, video chat affords a unique opportunity for couples to share presence over distance, which in turn provides intimacy.

However, there has not been research examining the relationship between participants' protective behavior toward human/AI team-mates and their beliefs about their behavior. A study was conducted in which 32 participants played two sessions of a cooperative game, once with a ""presumed"" human and once with an AI team-mate; players could ""draw fire"" from a common enemy by ""yelling"" at it. Overwhelmingly, players claimed they ""drew fire"" on behalf of the presumed human more than for the AI team-mate; logged data indicates the opposite.  The main contribution of this paper is to provide evidence of the mismatch in player beliefs about their actions and actual behavior with humans or agents and provides possible explanations for the differences.","1.

With caps, each bit of data consumed comes at a cost against a monthly quota or a running tab. Yet, relatively little work has considered the implications of this usage-based pricing model on the user experience. In this paper, we present results from a qualitative study of households living with bandwidth caps. Our findings suggest home users grapple with three uncertainties regarding their bandwidth usage: invisible balances, mysterious processes, and multiple users. We discuss how these uncertainties impact their usage and describe the potential for better tools to help monitor and manage data caps. We conclude that as a community we need to cater for users under Internet cost constraints. ","1.

The eLabBench supports the organization of personal information, capture of experimental work for later access, and the use of a variety of computational resources directly at the lab bench. We deployed the eLabBench in a biology laboratory for 16 weeks, and invited seven molecular biologists to run experiments on it. We report on how they used the bench and how it fitted within their larger experimental process. The main impact of the eLabBench lies in the changes it sparked off in preparing, running, and documenting lab experiments. By supporting computation at the bench and management of physical objects in the office, the eLabBench blurred the separation between office and laboratory work. Based on our observations, we discuss how interactive systems for laboratories such as the eLabBench can support a more exploratory or design-oriented way of ""doing"" science.","1.

Interactive tools to teach social skills that are personalized to the individual's needs show promise, but it is challenging to author them. We describe the design, development, and preliminary evaluation of an approach to using human computation that enables the creation of models of complex and interesting social scenarios, possible obstacles that may arise in those scenarios, and potential solutions to those obstacles. Our preliminary evaluation of the models confirms that these models have the potential to help an author create a social skills instructional module. ","1.

Tome collects user-interaction histories via an interface instrumentation library as end users complete tasks; these histories are compiled using the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) into task completion-time predictions using CogTool.  With many histories, Tome can model prevailing strategies for tasks without needing an HCI specialist to describe users' interaction steps.  An unimplemented design change can be evaluated by perturbing a Tome task model in CogTool to reflect the change, giving a new performance prediction.  We found that predictions for quick (5-60s) query tasks in an instrumented brain-map interface averaged within 10% of measured expert times.  Finally, we modified a Tome model to predict closely the speed-up yielded by a proposed interaction before implementing it.","1. Callahan, S. P., Freire, J., Santos, E., Scheidegger, C. E., Silva, C.

We present an indoor navigation system called Navatar that allows for localization and navigation by exploiting the physical characteristics of indoor environments, taking advantage of the unique sensing abilities of users with visual impairments, and minimalistic sensing achievable with low cost accelerometers available in smartphones. Particle filters are used to estimate the user's location based on the accelerometer data as well as the user confirming the presence of anticipated tactile landmarks along the provided path. Navatar has a high possibility of large-scale deployment, as it only requires an annotated virtual representation of an indoor environment. A user study with six blind users determines the accuracy of the approach, collects qualitative experiences and identifies areas for improvement.","1.

The trails generated from this process can be surfaced by search engines to help users engaged in these tasks. However, if search engines are going to have people generate trails they need to understand whether there is value in using domain experts for trailblazing (or whether novices are sufficient). In this paper, we describe the findings of a user study of trailblazing in the medical domain, comparing domain novices and experts. We observed differences in how people in each of the groups blazed trails and the value of the trails they generated; experts were more efficient and generated better-quality trails. Although there has been significant research on contrasting novice and expert search behaviors, to our knowledge there is no work (at least in the search domain) on establishing whether artifacts created by domain experts (trails in our case) are more valuable than those created by novices. The answer to this question is important for system designers who want to learn whether investing in domain expertise is worthwhile.","1. Agichtein, E., Brill, E., and Dumais, S.

These are the changes we made in each round. \  \ ROUND ONE \ We would like to once again thank the reviewers and shepherd for the extraordinary amount of time and thought that they have invested in this paper. We were given feedback from the 3 reviewers, 2ACs, and the shepherd. In our rewrite of this paper, we worked primarily from the shepherd�s detailed requests and what we said we would do in our rebuttal, and then included reviewers� suggestions where possible. This letter describes those changes.  \  \ We trimmed the Introduction slightly but did not make major changes. Everyone seemed to agree that the topic is well-motivated. \  \ We changed the emphasis from being about the race versus income dichotomy to be about class and socioeconomic differences (which includes race, income, neighborhood and other factors). To do this, we: \ 1) made minor changes to the Related Work to include geographic differences among urban and suburban demographics which broadens the lens of class and socioeconomic status beyond race and income.  \ 2) deemphasized Group A and Group B division throughout the paper (we relabeled participants as low and high SES but focused more on describing participants instead of dichotomizing two groups). \ 3) changed �Writing about Race and Income� to �Intersectionality and Implications for HCI� and moved it to the Discussion section. We revised the body of that section to a) focus on reflexivity from participants� perspectives; and b) extend the notion of reflexivity to examine what this research means for the CHI community�s assumption and motivations.  \  \ We removed the reflexivity from our own perspective section from our Methods which R5 strongly said he/she did not want to see. R1 took the opposite stance and wanted to see more on reflexivity from our own perspective (�positioning of your Self�). We couldn�t easily satisfy both requests, but we drew on R1�s very extensive suggestions about reflexivity to write the Intersectionality and Implications for HCI sections which both have reflexivity at the heart of them.  \  \ We tightened the Summary of Results to one short paragraph. The shepherd and R3 said the first version was not helpful and furthered the Group A/Group B dichotomy which we are trying to reduce in this revised version. We used the extra space to expand the Discussion section as described above.  \  \ We combined Tables 1 and 2 into 1 table and made it easier to read.  \  \ We fixed the references per R3�s request.  \  \ We rewrote the Supporting Parent Literacy subsection in the Discussion to focus on specific similarities and differences among demographics and implications for supporting parent technological literacy.  \  \  \ We should note that we positioned our discussion around parents� attitudes and approaches instead of around �parent-child interaction� which the shepherd suggested (and we had in fact considered in early versions of this paper). We hope this slight adjustment is acceptable. We did not interview children in this study or focus on the interactions specifically so wanted to be clear in our terminology that we weren�t looking specifically at how parents and children interact.  \  \ We tried to satisfy as many concerns as possible in this revision. We appreciate what has obviously been a lot of time and discussion among reviewers, ACs, and the shepherd in helping us improve this paper.  \  \  \  \ ROUND TWO \  \  \ We thank you again for your extensive feedback and attention to detail. Here we summarize the changes we made in response to the most recent round of feedback. \  \ We described what we mean by socioeconomic status and related our definitions to prior work by Ames et al. We defined race and class as well, and tied our uses to well-known benchmarks in the U.S. like the U.S. Census.  \  \ We rewrote the Related Work section so that the bullet points are now in paragraph form.  \  \ We revised the Conclusion to make specific recommendations for HCI researchers. We tried to make stronger statements, but without overstating what we can assert based on just one study.  \  \ We tightened the abstract and succinctly presented our major results.  \  \ We clarified that our focus on parents and teens was there from the beginning of the study.  \  \ We clarified that �any other group� on page 2 referred to any other racial group.  \  \ We expanded on what is disruptive about middle school years for teens with citations to developmental changes that teens go through.  \  \ We explained the ways that Atlanta is representative of the racial and socioeconomic differences that exist in the U.S. more generally.  \  \ We clarified how we moved from categories to themes in the methods section.  \  \ We revised parts of the Discussion section to tie back to other research, develop the discussion further, and to make stronger claims based on our results.  \  \ There is one area in the Discussion where we did not make major changes�per all the earlier reviews we did not �disentangle� race and income from our broader focus on socioeconomic status. We originally wrote about race and income and the reviewers said that since we cannot tell what is based on race versus income versus anything else we should present our result in terms of socioeconomic status. We left our results presented in terms of SES, but we did make it clear in the methods that race and income are prominent parts of SES among our participants.  \  \ Can you explain how you would like the quotations to be formatted? There doesn�t seem to be a consensus in past proceedings about how to format quotes�we apologize if we missed this in the instructions somewhere.  \  \ We fixed the cosmetic issues. \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 23:05",""

Within information studies, researchers [such as 32, 6] have shown how individual events of selection and description inevitably form judgments about the collected materials. This paper describes a process in which designers purposefully use the elements of selection, description, organization, and arrangement to ""write"" a resource collection as a form of rhetorical expression. The design process was implemented in two classroom settings. In the more successful second implementation, the role of the audience in structuring a rhetorical interaction was emphasized, and collection design was conceptualized as designing a dialogue between author and audience. The formalized critique of existing collection designs was a key element in enabling this dialogic orientation. ","1. Aristotle. On rhetoric. George Kennedy, trans. New York: Oxford Press, 1991. \ 2.

Errors in both stages could influence flicking accuracy. We investigated flicking interactions on curved interactive surface to evaluate which type of error influences accuracy. Therefore, we carried out three user studies to analyze how each stage of flicking on a curved surface is influenced. Our main findings are: 1)  Flicking gestures are more accurate if horizontal and vertical surface are joined by a continuous curve than if they are separated by an edge or gap. 2) Flicking gestures on curved surfaces are mostly influenced by the motor execution stage of the gesture rather than the visual perception stage. 3) Flicking accuracy decreases as the starting point of the gesture is moved closer to the curve. 4) We conclude with a first mathematical model to estimate the error users will make when flicking across a curve.","1.

In this paper we analyze; firstly, the negative effect of walking on text-input performance, particularly the users' main difficulties and error patterns. We focused our research on thumb typing, since this is a commonly used technique to interact with touch interfaces. Secondly, we analyze how these effects can be compensated by two-hand interaction and increasing target size. We asked 22 participants to input text under three mobility conditions (seated, slow walking, and normal walking) and three hand conditions (one-hand/portrait, two-hand/portrait, and two-hand/landscape). Results show that independently of hand condition, mobility significantly decreased input quality, leading to specific error patterns. Moreover, it was shown that target size can compensate the negative effect of walking, while two-hand interaction does not provide additional stability or input accuracy. We finish with implications for future designs.","1. Barnard, L., Yi, J., Jacko, J., Sears, A. An empirical comparison of use-in-motion evaluation scenarios for mobile computing devices.

In contrast to most tiled-display systems, the only requirement for participation is for devices to have an internet connection and a web browser. Thus, most smartphones, tablets, laptops and similar devices can be used. Phone as a Pixel uses a color-transition encoding scheme to identify and locate displays. This approach has several advantages: devices can be arbitrarily arranged (i.e., not in a grid) and infrastructure consists of a single conventional camera. Further, additional devices can join at any time without re-calibration. These are desirable properties to enable collective displays in contexts like sporting events, concerts and political rallies. In this paper we describe our system, show results from proof-of-concept setups, and quantify the performance of our approach on hundreds of displays.","1.

However, few studies have ethnographically observed design teams that use personas, and fewer studies have looked specifically at how designers linguistically invoke personas in their decision-making sessions. This discourse analysis of the decision-making sessions of designers at a top tier design firm reveals that although the designers dedicate much time researching, developing, and refining personas, personas themselves make relatively few appearances in the designers� language during decision-making sessions. This study shows that, for persuasive ends, these designers, who are advocates of personas, routinely use other less precise and more designer-centric linguistic mechanisms in lieu of personas. Despite the scarcity of personas in the decision-making sessions, this ethnographic case study also explores the value of personas for this team even when the personas are not explicitly linguistically invoked.

This is due, in part, to search engines not providing feedback about how search behavior can be improved. Because feedback is an essential part of learning, we created the Search Dashboard, which provides an interface for reflection on personal search behavior. The Dashboard aggregates and presents an individual's search history and provides comparisons with that of archetypal expert profiles. Via a five-week study of 90 Search Dash-board users, we find that users are able to change aspects of their behavior to be more in line with that of the presented expert searchers. We also find that reflection can be beneficial, even without comparison, by changing participants' views about their own search skills, what is possible with search, and what aspects of their behavior may influence search success. Our findings demonstrate a new way for search engines to help users modify their search behavior for positive outcomes.","1. Aula, A., Khan, R.M. & Guan, Z.

These additions are described below in the optional changes section. \  \ **Required Changes \ -Of the eight tables we had originally, we removed three, changed four to bar charts, and improved the formatting and clarified the caption in the only remaining table. \  \ -We have also eliminated participant ratings with regards to  how ""interesting"" and ""useful"" they found different aspects of the Search Dashboard. This change eliminated several paragraphs from the Results and three tables. \  \ -We also changed all-but-one of the tables to bar charts. This allowed us to simplify the presentation of data, and in one case add pairwise comparisons to a figure without detracting from its readability. \   \ -We did not do this for the table which presents behavioral change. We wanted to maintain the data reported in this final table, and did not feel that changing this table to charts would be possible nor clarify things. So, we made some minor formatting changes, and amended the caption to further draw the reader's attention to the important table elements. \  \ **Other Changes \ -Advanced Search Operators for selecting experts - we described the problem with misidentifying and missing experts with our approach of using operators, but described how the approach achieved its goal. Added to Important Consideration section. \  \ -Study Length and Novelty effect - Acknowledged the possibility of a novelty effect and the need for a longer study to address this and to see if the impact of the Dashboard persists (in the Important Considerations section). \  \ -Gauge charts - Described Pilots with other representations in the section describing the Dashboard system. \  \ -Search Success - added a paragraph to the study section to clarify the focus on change in behavior and attitudes, rather than on search performance. \  \ -Initial Survey - Provided more details on the initial survey provided # of questions,email solicitation and described why their was a focus on interest \  \ -Fixed typos, fixed references, and clarified statements as recommended by reviewers \  \ -Paper Title - Small change to the paper title to represent the importance of comparison \  \ -Video figure -- added names, affiliations and final title, converted to mp4 \  \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 23:07",""

Via 450 interviews in Bangalore, India, we measure participant response bias due to interviewer demand characteristics and the role of social and demographic factors in influencing that bias. We find that respondents are about 2.5x more likely to prefer a technological artifact they believe to be developed by the interviewer, even when the alternative is identical. When the interviewer is a foreign researcher requiring a translator, the bias towards the interviewer's artifact increases to 5x. In fact, the interviewer's artifact is preferred even when it is degraded to be obviously inferior to the alternative. We conclude that participant response bias should receive more attention within the CHI community, especially when designing for underprivileged populations.","1.

However, current multi-view displays rely on special hardware, thus significantly limiting their availability to consumers and adoption in everyday scenarios. In this paper, we present a pure software solution (i.e. with no hardware modification) that allows us to present two independent views concurrently on the most widely used and affordable type of LCD screen, namely Twisted Nematic (TN). We achieve this by exploiting a technical limitation of the technology which causes these LCDs to show varying brightness and color depending on the viewing angle.

To extend the reach of answers to thousands of new information needs, we introduce Tail Answers: a large collection of direct answers that are unpopular individually, but together address a large proportion of search traffic. These answers cover long-tail needs such as the average body temperature for a dog, substitutes for molasses, and the keyboard shortcut for a right-click. We introduce a combination of search log mining and paid crowdsourcing techniques to create Tail Answers. A user study with 361 participants suggests that Tail Answers significantly improved users' subjective ratings of search quality and their ability to solve needs without clicking through to a result.

Typical examples include manipulating geometrical shapes in a vector graphics editor, navigating a document using a scrollbar, or moving and resizing windows on the desktop.  \ As in many such cases, there will not be any mechanism to undo them, requiring users to manually revert to the previous state using a similar sequence of direct manipulation actions. The associated motor and cognitive costs can be high. We argue that proper and consistent mechanisms to support undo in this context are lacking, and present Dwell-and-Spring, an interaction technique that uses the metaphor of springs to enable users to undo direct manipulations. A spring widget pops up whenever the user dwells during a press-drag-release interaction, giving her the opportunity to either cancel the current manipulation or undo the last one. The technique is generic and can easily be implemented on top of existing applications to complement the traditional undo command. Empirical evaluation shows that users quickly adopt it as soon as they discover it. \ ","1. Akers, D., Simpson, M., Jeffries, R., and Winograd, T.

However, interaction with structures may be complex and not well integrated with interaction with the content. Based on contextual inquiries and past work, we have identified a number of requirements for the interaction with graphical structures. We have designed and explored two interactive tools that rely on implicit and explicit structures: ManySpector, an inspector for multiple objects that help visualize and interact with used values; and links that users can draw between object properties to provide a dependency. The interactions with the tools augment the scope of interactions to multiple objects. A study showed that users understood the interactions and could use them to perform complex graphical tasks.","1. Appert, C, Beaudoin-Lafon, M, Mackay, W. E.

Omnipedia highlights the similarities and differences that exist among Wikipedia language editions, and makes salient information that is unique to each language as well as that which is shared more widely. We detail solutions to numerous front-end and algorithmic challenges inherent to providing users with a multilingual Wikipedia experience. These include visualizing content in a language-neutral way and aligning data in the face of diverse information organization strategies. We present a study of Omnipedia that characterizes how people interact with information using a multilingual lens. We found that users actively sought information exclusive to unfamiliar language editions and strategically compared how language editions defined concepts. Finally, we briefly discuss how Omnipedia generalizes to other domains facing language barriers.","1. Adafre, S.F. and de Rijke, M. 2006.

Because different communication infrastructures are available, situations of encounter are shown to be potentially seamful and to support multi-layered participation frames. Our observations show  a variety of encounter formats, among whom ""timid"" encounters are the most characteristic of the kind of sociality which may develop in urban public places turned into proximity-sensitive ""hybrid ecologies""  The normative order which governs such encounters is marked by a tension between the minimality expected of encounters with strangers in urban spaces, and the concern for identification and focused interaction that derives from being engaged in proximal digital communication.

Full-body motion-control games provide an opportunity for these adults to remain active and engaged; these games are not designed with age-related impairments in mind, which prevents the games from being leveraged to increase the activity levels of older adults. In this paper, we present two studies aimed at developing game design guidelines for full-body motion controls for older adults experiencing age-related changes and impairments. Our studies also demonstrate how full-body motion-control games can accommodate a variety of user abilities, have a positive effect on mood and, by extension, the emotional well-being of older adults. Based on our studies, we present seven guidelines for the design of full-body interaction in games. The guidelines are designed to foster safe physical activity among older adults, thereby increasing their quality of life.","1. Aarhus, R., Groenvall, E., Larsen, S.B., and Wollsen, S.

Twenty-three participants of diverse ethnicities, 11 women and 12 men (mean age, 21.7 years), were interviewed in same-sex discussion groups of four participants each. The interviews consisted of questions about the uses, benefits, and harms of social network sites and how people present themselves online. Qualitative analysis of the discussion group transcripts shows how young people explore their identities, cultivate and exploit social ties, experience interpersonal tensions, manage incompatible audiences, and respond to shifting affiliations and transitions. From this analysis, implications for social intervention and technical design are presented, focused on maintaining ties with pro-social family and friends and with maintaining separation between communication spheres of incompatible audiences. This work contributes to the growing literature on vital, deeply human experiences that have become associated with social network sites. ","1. Barkhuus, L., and Tashiro, J.

Including additional literature \ Responding to the reviewers, we added a 130-word paragraph to the introduction which now situates the paper within recent HCI research on homelessness, providing backing for the relevance of this work to HCI. We now cite the following papers:  \ �	Le Dantec, C. A., Farrell, R. G., Christensen, J. E., Bailey, M. Ellis, J. B., Kellogg, W. A., and Edwards, W. K.

Improved reporting of methods for data analysis  \ The reviewers requested additional methodological specificity on the process for data analysis. To address this concern we have revised the section �Data Analysis and Reporting� on p. 4. Specifically, we have lengthened this section from about 250 words to 440 words and have:  \  \ 1.	Revised and better summarized the analytical stance that we used in the analysis; and \ 2.	Reported on the procedural steps that we followed, details that were not included in the original submission. \  \ On p. 7 we have revised the setup to the discussion. In the new setup we refer back specifically to the process that was introduced on p. 4. In addition, responding to the reviewers, particularly R3, in this setup we include a qualification our ability to generalize. With these changes we have sought to: \ 1.	Present evidence that the process that we followed for the data analysis was robust; \ 2.	Better guide the reader through the chain of data analysis and interpretation, leading to implications; and \ 3.	Explicitly state the limits our ability to generalize these findings. \  \  \ 3. Writing revisions for improved clarity and specificity  \ We have revised the introduction to accommodate the HCI literature on homelessness. The introduction now engages the social network literature somewhat less but now situates this work in HCI literature as requested by reviewers.  \ We edited the methods section and cut out the following: \ 1.	We no longer report frequency of email usage in table #1; \ 2.	We no longer give examples of the discussion group questions, though we continue to refer the reader to Appendix 1 of reference #19; and \ 3.	We no longer report descriptive differences in transcript lengths.  \  \ We have substantially revised the conclusion (p. 9), seeking to soften claims of strong differences in the use of social network sites by homeless young people and young people who are not homeless (responding to R2).  In addition, throughout the manuscript we have sought to use language which does not suggest strong qualitative differences between homeless young people and other users of social network sites. \ For clarity of presentation and conciseness, we have reviewed the manuscript and made a number of small changes throughout.  \ We now turn to the specific requests for revision from the reviewers: \ R1 � Greater clarity on location of study. Response: We have indicated that the study location is north of downtown Seattle (p. 3) \ R1 � Awkward sentence. Response: We have re-written �No matter of social-economical standing, a serious embarrassment, a damaged relationship, or a lost job, caused in part by a social network site is troubling for any individual, whether middle school student or national political figure� to �No matter what one�s age or socio-economic standing, whether middle school student or politician, social network sites can lead to an embarrassment, a damaged relationship, or a lost job.� (p. 9).  \ R1 � Participant anonymity. Response: We have anonymized the state and city names in Marvin�s profile (p. 6). Relatedly, we have checked the other 7 portraits and believe that participants� privacy is adequately protected.  \ R2 � Rationale for discussion groups. Response: We have re-written a paragraph on p. 3 to explicitly present a rationale for the use of discussion groups.  We also briefly state how we sought to mitigate the downsides of group interviews.  \ R3 � Awkward sentence. Response: We have re-written �By their circumstances of life, homeless young people are likely to foreground extraordinary needs and uses, yet with possible relevance to all users� to �Second, as an extraordinary group of users, homeless young people are likely to exhibit extreme needs for social network sites, yet needs with possible relevance to all users.� (p. 2). \  \ R3 � Clarification of face-to-face or online networks. Response: We have revised the background to indicate when we refer to face-to-face and mediated ties (p. 2).  \  \ R3 � Numbered lists. Response: We have removed 5 of 6 numbered lists. For conciseness of presentation, we have retained one numbered list on p. 9.  \  \ R3 � Explanation of oral assent. Response: To clarify, we added the following sentence under the Procedure section (p. 3): �In order to protect participants� identities, and following approved human subjects protocols, all participants gave verbal assent only of their willingness to take part in the research.� \ R3 � �Internet� as a proper noun. Response: We have capitalized Internet in the text on p. 2 and p. 4. \ R3 � Contractions. Response: We have replaced the two contractions in the text on p. 4. [Note: Other contractions are in quotations from participants.] \ R3 � Decimal places. Response: We have rounded to 1 decimal place in Table 1. \  \ ","","design","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 22 12:32",""

Because the creation of such a video is relatively easy, the benefits-to-cost ratio may potentially be substantial, especially in settings where learned visual scanning strategies are indicators of expertise.  We suggest that two such examples are examinations of Chest X-Rays and histological slides.

Blind users cannot use visual CAPTCHAs, and it has been documented in the research literature that the existing audio CAPTCHAs have task success rates below 50% for blind users. The SoundsRight audio CAPTCHA presents a real-time audio-based challenge in which the user is asked to identify a specific sound (for example the sound of a bell or a piano) each time it occurs in a series of 10 sounds that are played through the computer�s audio system. Evaluation results from three rounds of usability testing document that the task success rate was higher than 90% for blind users.

Blind users had over 90% task success rate on our new real-time audio CAPTCHA. ","Jonathan ","Lazar","Based on the reviewer comments, the following modifications were made: \  \ Text added to clarify about the timing: \ �Currently the timing of the user�s response to hearing the target sound assumes that the user will press the space bar during the playing of the sound.  This assumed behavior is what our participants seemed to do intuitively with no prompting, other than the audio instructions which are provided in the system.� \  \ Text added to clarify about the error handling: \ �If the user misses hitting the space bar on even one sound, they must start again with a different and new challenge set of 10 sound clips. The real-time process does not allow for any correction of accidental input, consequently, any input error during the test results in a failed attempt.  A failed attempt results in a notification to the user, and an opportunity to try the CAPTCHA again with a new challenge.� \  \ Text added to clarify about our data collection methods: \ �The goal of this study was conducting usability evaluations to inform the design of the CAPTCHA application, not a strict empirical study between groups or different versions. All participants are blind, unable to use screen magnification, with previous experience in computers and the JAWS screen reading software, and 18 years or older. The participants did not have any documented hearing loss. Usability evaluations involving people with disabilities generally have very small sample sizes. The sample size of our study is larger than the sizes of most reported usability studies involving users with disabilities [9]. � \  \ Text added to clarify about decoys: \ �The application was modified to allow an administrator to flag target/decoy sound combinations that are too similar and could be confused. Once the administrator has flagged those combinations, the application will no longer use that decoy sound when generating a challenge set for that specific target sound.� \  \  \ Text added about threats from bots: \ �It is possible that a bot could be created to solve the SoundsRight CAPTCHA.  This bot would need to collect many sample challenge sound sets to analyze the sound library being used and the target sounds being produced.  Then using those samples through human identification, it could catalog what each sound is, and then be programmed to respond appropriately to the challenges, assuming that the sound set does not change. However, the sound library can easily be changed at any time, an administrator could easily add another sound clip to the database which would immediately be included in the generated challenge sets, which would result in that bot no longer being consistently successful.  Another important security feature that would deter that approach is the fixed time each challenge takes.  Every challenge takes a fixed amount of time (approx. 45 seconds in the current version), which would make this system a much less appealing target.� \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 14 23:13",""

The first feature is an input interface that accepts a variety of deformation-based gestures, providing a user with several ways of interacting with a small mobile device. The other feature is the ability to provide information to the user through haptic feedback by varying the stiffness of the interface. The features are suitable for enhancing mobile applications. They were implemented using only shape memory alloy (SMA) wires as the actuator. SMA wire is extremely flexible, making it ideal for deformable user interfaces. In MimicTile, SMA wires act as both actuators and external input sensors. The actuator function works by altering stiffness based on user input.

In our case, we studied frontline firefighting by observing the existing practice, by developing empathy through participation and by introducing new technology as triggering artifacts. Applying grounded theory, we distilled our findings into pattern language describing core aspects of this practice and their interaction. In a workshop, we introduced the pattern language to developers who had no previous knowledge of this practice and, in follow-up interviews, confronted them with new technology proposals for firefighters. Our study shows that pattern language, while not to be confused with an immutable description of the status quo or a direct path from contextual analysis to design, supports a reflective discussion of novel technology and the fit with and potential impact on existing practice.","1.

This paper presents an objective evaluation of several methods for the automated segmentation and classification of ES intervals from an eye movement recording, a technique that can be utilized to aid in the identification of usability problems during software usability testing. Techniques considered for automated segmentation of the eye movement recording into unique intervals include mouse/keyboard events and eye movement scanpaths. ES is identified by a number of eye movement metrics, including: fixation count, saccade amplitude, convex hull area, scanpath inflections, scanpath length, and scanpath duration. The ES intervals identified by each algorithm are compared to those produced by manual classification to verify the accuracy, precision, and performance of each algorithm. The results indicate that automated classification can be successfully employed to substantially reduce the amount of recorded data reviewed by HCI experts during usability testing, with relatively little loss in accuracy.","1.

A user is thus able to instantly convert any plush toy into a soft robot. The user can control the toy remotely or input the movement desired by moving the plush toy and having the data recorded and played back. Unlike other methods for animating plush toys, PINOKY is non-intrusive, so alterations to the toy are not required. In a user study, 1) the roles of plush toys in the participants' daily lives were examined, 2) how participants played with plush toys without PINOKY was observed, 3) how they played with plush toys with PINOKY was observed, and their reactions to the device were surveyed.

However, expert knowledge is often lacking in such markets, making it impossible to complete certain classes of tasks. In this work we introduce an alternative mechanism for crowdsourcing tasks that require specialized knowledge or skill: communitysourcing --- the use of physical kiosks to elicit work from specific populations. We investigate the potential of communitysourcing by designing, implementing and evaluating Umati: the communitysourcing vending machine. Umati allows users to earn credits by performing tasks using a touchscreen attached to the machine. Physical rewards (in this case, snacks) are dispensed through traditional vending mechanics. We evaluated whether communitysourcing can accomplish expert work by using Umati to grade Computer Science exams. We placed Umati in a university Computer Science building, targeting students with grading tasks for snacks. Over one week, 328 unique users (302 of whom were students) completed 7771 tasks (7240 by students). 80% of users had never participated in a crowdsourcing market before. We found that Umati was able to grade exams with 2% higher accuracy (at the same price) or at 33% lower cost (at equivalent accuracy) than traditional single-expert grading. Mechanical Turk workers had no success grading the same exams. These results indicate that communitysourcing can successfully elicit high-quality expert work from specific communities.","1. 99Designs. http://www.99designs.com/. Retrieved 9/2011. \ 2.

This has included trimming references to material outside the HCI field to focus on papers relevant to the community, as suggested by 2AC. \  \ Clarified motivation and fit \ We have clarified some of the issues which led to the design of the application, including three primary constraints: (1) the environment provides a digital information system at the patient's bedside, (2) food images, food weights and nutritional composition can be determined prior to assessment since hospital meals are of a consistent, standardized size and content, and (3) the assessment tool is designed to replace the broad estimates of current methods of food consumption in hospital settings and to give timely feedback for patient care. We also include two issues which contrast to current systems: As the assessment utilizes direct observation, no intermediary metaphors, objects or measures, which may be culturally exclusive, are required. By using the tool at time of consumption recall bias may be avoided. \  \ Evaluation \ The evaluation has been rewritten to clarify the exploratory nature of the study and to give clearer detail on how the study was carried out. \   \ Results \ Some minor changes were made to clarify the performance by novice vs. expert users, and give estimates of time taken. \  \ Discussion \ The discussion now includes greater reference to existing research and integrates clearer critical analysis. In reference to the constant underestimation, we note that: (Hernandez et al.) report that use of visual estimates typically results in overestimation of portion size. This may remain to be true, as users of the mappmal tool may overestimate food remaining on the plate, thus underestimating food consumed. \  \ We further relate the evaluation and results to existing research, particularly in light of the errors produced for ambiguous (amorphous, liquid) foods, and the use of household measures (e.g. handful, cup, spoon), alternative views (e.g. cross-sectional side view), and so on. \ We finally, clarify the limitations of the approach, including discussion of use by patients and the applicability to general contexts. \ ","","health","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 15:03",""

As proposed in the rebuttal we also removed figure 3 to deemphasize the idea of a possible model concerning congruency of visual and haptic display continuities. \  \ Choosing the connection setups \ We now point out in the introduction that the three display setups, which we tested in our study, are based on the most common display configurations (bezel, edge) and recent research prototypes (curve) (""An assembly of conventional displays will mostly involve crossing (a) a screen bezel [15] or (b) a hard edge [4] connecting the displays. Recently also (c) a curved segment was proposed as a display connection [14, 16, 17].""). This should help to understand the motivation of our selection of connection types. \  \ Implementation \ To avoid any confusion about the task condition we clarified that there was no further constraining mechanism beside the shown line (""No further constraining mechanisms (e.g. a constraining force) were used.""). We also specified our description of the pointer warping in the bezel setup (""The bezel in the respective setup consisted of a wooden strip mounted in front of the edge connection. Consequently the pointer had to bypass the occluded display area behind the bezel to simulate a real bezel. As we did not want the resulting pointer movement to suffer from a warping effect, but rather be fluid and understandable, we derived the last-known pointer movement direction near the bezel and beamed the pointer to the other display in that direction similar to the Mouse ether technique [3]."") \  \ Trajectories \ Beside the refinement of figure 2 (additional lines for a better guidance) we also added a remark about the influence of the connection on the trajectories of touch input (""Beside this we also noticed that dragging path are much more scattered across the transition in the edge setup compared to curve and bezel.""). \  \ Further interactions in the study \ We added the other (and obvious) significant effects found in our study (e.g. ""There were also significant effects (p<.05) of task (F(1,45) = 176.526) and input x task (F(1,45) =15.320) on user�s accuracy.""). We also added an explanation why we think that edge's poor ratings for touch input might not be entirely obvious (""Bezel�s bad ratings for the connection area might be caused by rather unnatural arm poses described in the next section."" --> Further Observations). \  \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 16 17:50",""

In particular, we contribute a set of novel and practical gaze-supported selection techniques for distant displays. Designed according to the principle gaze suggests, touch confirms they include an enhanced gaze-directed cursor, local zoom lenses and more elaborated techniques utilizing manual fine positioning of the cursor via touch. In a comprehensive user study with 24 participants, we investigated the potential of these techniques for different target sizes and distances. All novel techniques outperformed a simple gaze-directed cursor and showed individual advantages. In particular those techniques using touch for fine cursor adjustments (MAGIC touch) and for cycling through a list of possible close-to-gaze targets (MAGIC tab) demonstrated a high overall performance and usability.","1.

Intelligent agents and recommender systems are gaining widespread use, potentially creating a need for end users to understand how these systems operate in order to fix their agent's personalized behavior. This paper explores the effects of mental model soundness on such personalization by providing structural knowledge of a music recommender system in an empirical study. Our findings show that participants were able to quickly build sound mental models of the recommender system's reasoning, and that participants who most improved their mental models during the study were significantly more likely to make the recommender operate to their satisfaction. These results suggest that by helping end users understand a system's reasoning, intelligent agents may elicit more and better feedback, thus more closely aligning their output with each user's intentions.","1.

Also, the text and Table 1 are now explicit that Mental Model Soundness was computed based on the raw correctness scores weighted by confidence. \  \ * We removed the claims about early presentation of explanations to help induce sound mental models.  \  \ * We reworded the Risk Reduction section (RQ3) to focus on Confidence, which is a more accurate fit to that part of our results. \  \ * We redid the tag clouds (Figures 5 & 6) in a monochrome color scheme, and the text has been updated to explain that a word's size is indicative of its  frequency. \  \ * We updated the text to make explicit that the self-efficacy questionnaire we used has been validated. \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","Honorable Mention","Sep 23 18:07",""

We present the PolyZoom technique where users progressively build hierarchies of focus regions, stacked on each other such that each subsequent level shows a higher magnification. Correlation graphics show the relation between parent and child viewports in the hierarchy. To validate the new technique, we compare it to standard navigation techniques in two user studies, one on multiscale visual search and the other on multifocus interaction.

It provides each household with fine-grained, near real time feedback on their water consumption, as well as using techniques like social comparison, weekly games, and news and chat to encourage water conservation. This study used logs, a survey and interviews to evaluate a 15-week pilot with 303 households. It describes the Portal's design, and discusses its adoption, use and impacts. The system resulted in a 6.6% decrease in water consumption, and the paper employs qualitative methods to look at the ways in which the Portal was (or wasn't) effective in supporting its users and enabling them to reduce their consumption.

To motivate people to receive the cognitive benefits of exercising in short bursts multiple times per day, we designed an engaging casual exergame. To determine whether there are cognitive benefits after playing our game, we conducted two studies to compare playing ten minutes of our casual exergame to a sedentary version of the game or exercise on a treadmill. We found acute cognitive benefits of the casual exergame over the sedentary version (but not treadmill exercise), demonstrated by significantly improved performance on two cognitive tests that require focus and concentration. Significant improvements were also found in participants� affective states after playing the casual exergame. Finally, our casual exergame produces similar exertion levels to treadmill exercise, but is perceived as more fun.","1. Barnett, A. et al. Active video games for youth: a systematic review.

However, there are few systematic studies of enhancing spatial ability with mobile devices, and applications such as turn-by-turn navigation systems have even been associated with a decline in spatial skills. In this paper we present a study based on the 1971 Shepard-Metzler mental rotation test but performed on a mobile-phone handset and a tablet PC. Our study extends the original experiment with the incorporation of touch and tilt interaction techniques, in order to determine if these affect the use and acquisition of spatial skills. Results suggest that the task is performed faster, and with no significant difference in accuracy, when participants rely on mental abilities rather than interaction techniques to perform 3D rotations. We also find significant differences between tablet and phone handset platforms under interactive conditions. We conclude that applications on mobile devices could be designed to enhance rather than erode spatial skills, by supporting the use of imagination to align real and virtual content.","1. Aretz, A.

As the number of custom gestures grows it becomes increasingly difficult to 1) know if new gestures will conflict with existing gestures, and 2) know how to extend existing code to reliably recognize the complete gesture set. Proton is a novel framework that addresses both of these problems. Using Proton, the application developer declaratively specifies each gesture as a regular expression over a stream of touch events. Proton statically analyzes the set of gestures to report conflicts, and it automatically creates gesture recognizers for the entire set. To simplify the creation of complex multitouch gestures, Proton introduces gesture tablature, a graphical notation that concisely describes the sequencing of multiple interleaved touch actions over time. Proton contributes a graphical editor for authoring tablatures and automatically compiles tablatures into regular expressions. We present the architecture and implementation of Proton, along with three proof-of-concept applications. These applications demonstrate the expressiveness of the framework and show how Proton simplifies gesture definition and conflict resolution.","1. Adya, A., Howell, J., Theimer, M., Bolosky, W.

In conducting this investigation, we extended the Natural Programming methodology (a user-centered design method for HCI researchers of programming environments), to add an explicit method for mapping the outcomes of NP's empirical investigations to a language design. This provided us with a concrete way to make the design leap from empirical assessment of users' needs to a language. The contributions of our work are therefore: (1) empirical evidence about the content and sequence of cognitive modelers' information needs when debugging, (2) a new, empirically derived, design specification for a debugging interaction language for cognitive modelers, and (3) an initial case study of our ""Natural Programming Plus"" methodology.

We have made the following changes in response to your requests: \  \ Major requests: \  \ * Fix the confusion over scope:  \ We modified the introduction to clarify that the work is in support of debugging tools for cognitive modelers, not for general debugging. \  \ * Consider dropping �with Natural Programming Plus� from the title:  \ We thought very deeply about it, but rather than drop all mention of it, we clarified the implied claim. Specifically, the title now says �initial case study�, to make very clear that NP+ has not been validated and that we do not know how it will generalize: it is just a first step. We�ve also made deep changes to the introduction to remove implied claims about the generalizability of NP+. The text now merely describes and names the technique we used, and reports on how it functioned in our case. The discussion and conclusion also now reinforce this stance and are explicit about the fact that its generality is not established. \  \ * Was a task analysis rather than a programming language design?  \ In light of R1�s critique, we added text to the introduction to explain why an interactive language like this (for �secondary programming�, a point we now make explicit in the introduction) straddles the line between �programming language� and �task�, why the complexity went beyond most task analyses, and why in the end we chose to use NP.  \  \ Other requests not highlighted by the ACs: \  \ * Usefulness for other domains outside Cog Modeling/ACT-R: \ We have added a paragraph to the discussion speculating on the kinds of domains our debugging abstractions might generalize to \  \ * Study W: why the task was chosen/interface was limited/source code was hidden: \ Besides a better setup in the introduction, we revised the Study W description significantly to better motivate it and explain its design, and the discussion discusses the validity and implications of the choice of task \  \ * Other requests \ We made many small changes and additions throughout the paper to address the reviewers� other concerns \  \ We thank you and the reviewers for their time, and look forward to hearing from you. \  \ Sincerely, \ Chris Bogart","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 24 17:26",""

Largely taken for granted in everyday interface design, the typographical component, through its legibility and aesthetics, weighs heavily on the ubiquitous reading task at the heart of most visualizations and interactions. In this paper, we present a research project whose goal is the creation of a new typeface to display textual information on future aircraft interfaces. After an initial task analysis leading to the definition of specific needs, requirements and design principles, the design constantly evolves from an iterative cycle of design and experimentation. We present three experiments (laboratory and cockpit) used mainly to validate initial choices and fine-tune font properties. Results confirm the importance of rigorously testing the typographical component as a part of text output evaluation in interactive systems.","1. Bellenkes, A.H., Wickens, C.D. & Kramer, A.F.

The relevant section, ""legibility of digital font"", has been rewritten according to R5 and R2 criticisms.  The ""font widely used in aeronautical context"" is the one that is to be replaced by the one we are currently designing. Using this font as a comparison with our prototype was relevant and not a bias to justify the design. A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) prevents us from naming this aeronautical font or graphically presenting the whole alphabet (nonetheless, figure 5 presents some characters from this font). \ Additionally, we have substantially rewritten the abstract, introduction and discussion.

We developed a typing game that records how users touch on the standard Android keyboard to investigate users' typing behaviour. 47,770,625 keystrokes from 72,945 installations have been collected by publishing the game. By visualizing the touch distribution we identified a systematic skew and derived a function that compensates this skew by shifting touch events. By updating the game we conduct an experiment that investigates the effect of shifting touch events, changing the keys' labels, and visualizing the touched position. Results based on 6,603,659 keystrokes and 13,013 installations show that visualizing the touched positions using a simple dot decreases the error rate of the Android keyboard by 18.3% but also decreases the speed by 5.2% with no positive effect on learnability. The Android keyboard outperforms the control condition but the constructed shift function further improves the performance by 2.2% and decreases the error rate by 9.1%. We argue that the shift function can improve existing keyboards at no costs.","1. Apple Inc. iOS Human Interface Guidelines, 2010. \ 2. Balakrishnan, V., and Yeow, P.

To address this concern, we developed ShoeSense, a wearable system consisting in part of a shoe-mounted depth sensor pointing upward at the wearer. ShoeSense recognizes relaxed and discreet as well as large and demonstrative hand gestures. In particular, we designed three gesture sets (Triangle, Radial, and Finger-Count) for this setup, which can be performed without visual attention. The advantages of ShoeSense are illustrated in five scenarios: (1) quickly performing frequent operations without reaching for the phone, (2) discreetly performing operations without disturbing others, (3) enhancing operations on mobile devices, (4) supporting accessibility, and (5) artistic performances. We present a proof-of-concept, wearable implementation based on a depth camera and report on a lab study comparing social acceptability, physical and mental demand, and user preference. A second study demonstrates a 94-99% recognition rate of our recognizers. ","1.	Adidas Megalizer: http://popsop.com/44586 \ 2.	Amft O. and Lukowicz, P. 2009.

Little is known, however, about the effectiveness of these interfaces and their design space is relatively unexplored. We provide a taxonomy for the design space by identifying two axes: Measurement Scale for absolute rating vs. relative ranking, and Recall Support for the amount of information provided about previously recorded opinions. We present an exploration of the design space through iterative prototyping of three alternative interfaces and their evaluation. Among many findings, the study showed that users do take advantage of recall support in interfaces, preferring those that provide it. Moreover, we found that designing ranking systems is challenging; there may be a mismatch between a ranking interface that forces people to specify a total ordering for a set of items, and their mental model that some items are not directly comparable to each other.

Below is the summary of changes with respect to the final suggestions: \  \   1. Goal of the paper and framing: \   * The clarifications suggested by the reviewers are made in the paper. \   * The introduction of the paper is revised to better reflect our motivations, process and contributions. \   * The links between the formative study and the taxonomy are clarified further. \    \   2. Next steps and future directions: \   * The numerous hypotheses and proposed directions for future research that already existed in the paper (sometimes only implicitly), are now better emphasized in the paper. \ * The suggested future directions are summarized in the ""Summary and Conclusion"" section. \    \   3. Link between the formative study and what follows: \   * The link between each of the dimensions of the design space and the formative study are further clarified.  \    \   4. Improving the presentation of the formative study and its findings: \   * The description of the formative study is restructured for clarity and to provide more details about the study.  \   * The summary of findings of the formative study is rewritten and is linked to the literature.  \   * The corresponding figure is modified to be consistent with the order of the presentation of the information in the text. \    \   5. Linking the formative study to related work and Likert scales: \   * As mentioned above, the summary of the findings of formative study is rewritten and is linked to the literature.  \   *While several of the existing references ( 2, 8, 14, 13, and 19) discuss the issues in the context of Likert scale and survey research, the suggested citation (15) is added to ensure that readers will have sufficient clues for exploring the relevant literature. \    \   6. Qualitative data and generality of the comments: \   * The qualitative aspects of data collection and analysis are described in greater detail.  \   * The relation between the quantitative data and qualitative data and how they complemented each other is explained. Because not every participant commented on every issue, the qualitative data is further integrated with the quantitative data to suggest the generality of the comments. \      \   7. Improving clarity based on the reviews: \   * Many of the suggestions for clarification are applied in the revision of the ""Introduction"", ""Formative study"", and ""Tasks and Procedure"" sections. \   * The discussions in the rebuttal are now reflected in the paper and the discussed limitations are emphasized to a greater extent. \    \    \   A comparison of the revised and the original versions, generated using MS-Word's Compare feature, is available at: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nobarany/compare.pdf \ ","","user experience","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 18:44",""

However, hierarchical organisations are known to slow down expert users. This paper proposes the use of spatial memory in combination with hierarchy flattening as a means of improving GUI performance. We demonstrate these concepts through the design of a command selection interface, called CommandMaps, and analyse its theoretical performance characteristics. We then describe two studies evaluating CommandMaps against menus and Microsoft's Ribbon interface for both novice and experienced users. Results show that for novice users, there is no significant performance difference between CommandMaps and traditional interfaces -- but for experienced users, CommandMaps are significantly faster than both menus and the Ribbon.","1.

We conducted a study to investigate the natural use profiles of PTA, which describes the features of PTA in the course of normal pen use such as writing and drawing. First, the study reveals the ranges of PTA in normal pen use, which can distinguish pen events accidently occurring in normal drawing and writing from those used for mode switch. The natural use profiles also show that azimuth is least likely to cause false pen mode switching while tip pressure is most likely to cause false pen mode switching. Second, the study reveals correlations among various modalities, indicating that pressure plus azimuth is superior to other pairs for dual-modality control.","1. Balakrishnan, R. and MacKenzie, S.

This paper demonstrates that we can use non-invasive methods to detect signals coming from the brain that users naturally and effortlessly generate while using a computer system. If used with care, this additional information can lead to systems that respond appropriately to changes in the user's state.

We think that these illustrate the results better than the tables that had been there. \  \ We put in additional details about the adaptation mechanism. We put in more details about the classification features and methodology and added a reference to a dissertation with more details. \  \ For the subjective robot perception ratings, we made notes to clarify that these are preliminary results (and only from 6 subjects). We also changed the figure to show box plots which are better for representing the non-parametric data. \  \ We also made notes of the inverse adaptation in the experiment and also referenced Pope, 1995 which had a similar design. We also tried to make it clearer that the adaptive behavior is always the same - it is just the onset of the autonomy that changes in the different conditions.  \  \  We fixed the issue where the word ""condition"" was used to mean two different types of conditions in the earlier draft. Now, the term ""condition"" is only used for the three adaptive conditions in the main experiment (non-adaptive, adaptive and maladaptive). For the branching, dual task and delay tasks, we refer to them as multitasking exercises or calibration exercises.  \  \ We clarified our expectations about performance that we expected from the different adaptive conditions. \  \ We did an analysis of the NASA-TLX dimensions (performance, frustration, etc.)  and reported these results.  \  \ We included the post-hoc tests for the results with statistically significant results.  \  \ We added a sentence in the first paragraph to note that human to human communication generates internal physiological activity (even if we do not use it for standard communication).  \  \ We provided example scenarios to clarify the differences between branching, dual task and delay. \  \ Fixed typos and made other minor changes. \  \ Thank you for all of the useful feedback!","","","","FormatComplete","","Honorable Mention","Nov 12 16:08",""

In this paper, we investigate how a statistical model of color naming can enable user interfaces to meaningfully mimic this link and support novel interactions. We present a method for constructing a probabilistic model of color naming from a large, unconstrained set of human color name judgments. We describe how the model can be used to map between colors and names and define metrics for color saliency (how reliably a color is named) and color name distance (the similarity between colors based on naming patterns). We then present a series of applications that demonstrate how color naming models can enhance graphical interfaces: a color dictionary & thesaurus, name-based pixel selection methods for image editing, and evaluation aids for color palette design.","1.

Although game developers frequently use tutorials to teach game mechanics, little is known about how tutorials affect game learnability and player engagement. Seeking to estimate this value, we implemented eight tutorial designs in three video games of varying complexity and evaluated their effects on player engagement and retention. The results of our multivariate study of over 45,000 players show that the usefulness of tutorials depends greatly on game complexity. Although tutorials increased play time by as much as 29% in the most complex game, they did not significantly improve player engagement in the two simpler games. Our results suggest that investment in tutorials may not be justified for games with mechanics that can be discovered through experimentation.","1. E. Adams.

An initial experiment characterises four diverse scrolling input devices -- a standard 'notched' scroll wheel, a high performance 'inertial' wheel, an isometric scrolling joystick, and a trackpad -- and the results are used to calibrate several gain function parameters. A second experiment validates the method, showing that it allows faster scrolling in long and short documents than current scrolling-device gain methods, and that subjective preferences favour it.

The recorded gestures were then analyzed according to multiple measures characterizing many aspects of stroke gestures. Our findings were as follows: (1) Finger drawn gestures were quite different to pen drawn gestures in basic measures including size ratio and average speed. Finger drawn gestures tended to be larger and faster than pen drawn gestures. They also differed in shape geometry as measured by, for example, aperture of closed gestures, corner shape distance and intersecting points deviation; (2) Pen drawn gestures and finger drawn gestures were similar in several measures including articulation time, indicative angle difference, axial symmetry and proportional shape distance; (3) There were interaction effects between gesture implement (finger vs. pen) and target gesture size and gesture complexity. Our findings show that half of the features we tested were performed well enough by the finger. This finding suggests that ""finger friendly"" systems should exploit these features when designing finger interfaces and avoid using the other features in which the finger does not perform as well as the pen.","1.

In this paper we explore different user interfaces for undo/redo for co-located collaborative workspaces, such as large interactive whiteboards. A preliminary study revealed that users expect neither a global nor personal undo, but rather a regional undo. We propose and evaluate three automatic regional undo/redo techniques (clustering, workspace, field of view) designed for a large interactive whiteboard. The results of the evaluation showed that an undo technique based on users� field of view was most preferred, while the content-based clustering technique produced most errors. We conclude with potential improvements to the developed techniques, and propose a set of design recommendations for implementing regional undo/redo on large interactive surfaces.","1. Abowd, G.

Furthermore we clarified the description of the sections procedure and design by using a more consistent wording and improving the description of how we matched the results to the different undo methods.  \  \  \ Regional Undo/Redo: \ ------------------- \ We included ""pre-defined"" and ""manual"" regional undo/redo into this section, and also added a sentence clarifying that the focus of this paper is on ""Automatic Undo/Redo Techniques"" as promised in the rebuttal (R1, R2). \  \ Furthermore we weakened the interpretation of the background studies results from ""users expect regional undo"" to ""the study suggests that users ..."", as this study does not prove this, but only suggest it (AC). \  \  \ Automatic Undo/Redo Techniques: \ ------------------------------- \ We clarified the description of how the workspace can be manually moved and resized, although we could not find space to add an additional figure as R1 recommended. But we think the new description (in combination with the already present figure) is much clearer now. \  \ Furthermore we fixed Figure 12 which was not consistent with the text (R1). \  \  \ Second evaluation: \ ----------------- \  \ Based on our rebuttal, we have restructured and clarified the section ""Tasks"" in the second evaluation to clarify that reduced recognition quality was used on all tasks. Furthermore we described the general setup of the tasks in a higher detail to clarify that each task consisted of two parts mimicking different undo use cases (R3, PC). \  \ Furthermore added more detail on how the undo-errors were counted and classified as we promised in the rebuttal (PC,R2) and also added the total numbers of errors. \  \ Discussion: \ ----------- \  \ We removed the design recommendation to use pre-defined regions, as this cannot be drawn from the user study (R1,R2). \  \ Limitations: \ ------------ \  \ Moreover, we extended the limitations according to our rebuttal and emphasized it by moving it into a own section (H1). \  \  \ References: \ ----------- \  \ We have added following references as AC recommended: \  \ Eric Saund, David Fleet, Daniel Larner, and James Mahoney. 2003.

We introduce the �ambivalent socialiser�, a person who is simultaneously keen but also reluctant to engage with others via social media. Our contribution is to identify four approaches to introducing sociality to ambivalent socialisers: structured socialising, incidental socialising, eavesdropping and trace sensing. We discuss the rationale for these approaches and show how they address recent critiques of persuasive technology. Furthermore, we provide actionable insights for designers of persuasive technology by showing how these approaches can be implemented in a social media application.","1. Christakis, N. and Fowler, J.

These are categorised in a similar fashion to the original discussion, which still contain some summary for contextual purposes and justification of the resulting guildeline. Each sub-sub-section of the discussion generally concludes with a guideline as summarised below: \  \ - Make use of collected data transparent to increase awareness of constraints on efficacy \ - Target achievable goals and use devices at times when the data collected can be used directly \ - Make use of human intervention to address misuse \ - Don't assume that such devices require the same level of security as elections \ - Visibility of results raises credibility, but requires closer attention to study its effects \ - Lower barriers to participation and create engaging user experiences \ - Balance the needs of the public with the needs of parties actioning change \ - Deploy in key locations in the community and make use of this location data \  \ GENERAL CHANGES \  \ - Added to the initial concept discussion regarding our decision to use binary questions: ""Our concept favoured a minimalist approach, such as simple binary questions, which we intended would lower barriers to participation."" (p3) \  \ - Added clarification about the source of feedback data: ""Like the initial fieldwork, these interviews were largely conducted by local people taking part in the journalism programme, but other interviews were conducted by a member of the project team and some stakeholders contacted us directly with their thoughts.""

In the first quasi-naturalistic exploratory study on a focus-in-context video system, we show a number of unique object referencing behaviours, including un-intentional or 'implicit' pointing and a number of scenarios where this was advantageous.

Participants achieved decreasing throughput values (a combined measure of movement time and accuracy in a target acquisition task) under increasing gap sizes. Participants likewise performed relatively poorly in tasks involving monitor crossing over all gap conditions, especially so when motion either originates or terminates very close to the gap. Both results could be considered surprising since in either case, the amount of mouse movement needed to successfully execute the task does not change based on physical gap size or a target's proximity to the edge. Fitts' law may underestimate the difficulty of movement tasks in MDEs.","1. Appert, C., Chapuis, O. and Beaudouin-Lafon, M. Evaluation of pointing performance on screen edges. In Proc.

We discuss strategies to reduce attrition, and present SilverCloud, a platform designed to provide more engaging online experiences. The paper presents the results of a practice-based clinical study in which 45 clients and 6 therapists used an online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy programme for depression. Pre and post-treatment assessments, using the Beck Depression Inventory, indicate a statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms, with a large effect size, for the moderate-to-severe clinical sub-sample receiving standalone online treatment (n=18). This group was the primary target for the intervention. A high level of engagement was also observed compared to a prior online intervention used within the same service. We discuss strategies for design in this area and consider how the quantitative and qualitative results contribute towards our understanding of engagement.","1. Andersson, G. & Cuijpers, P. (2009).

In this paper, we present ReticularSpaces; a multi-display smart space system built on the principles of activity-based computing. The focus of ReticularSpaces is to support: (i) unified interaction with applications and documents through ReticularUI, a novel distributed user interfaces design; (ii) management of the complexity of tasks between users and displays; (iii) mobile users in a local, remote or `nomadic' settings; and (iv) collaboration among local and remote users. We describe the motivation, design, and architecture of ReticularSpaces, and report from a preliminary feasibility study. The study shows that participants found ReticularSpaces useful and effective, but at the same time reveals new areas for research on smart environments.","1. R. Arthur and D. R.

The introduction was slightly rewritten to better emphasizes the different open research challenges in smart space research that our approach addresses. \  \ Related work section has been updated as discussed in the rebuttal. The related work ""matrix"" figure 2 has been updated as suggested by the reviewers. Furthermore, the structure of related work has been improved as discussed in the rebuttal and the difference between our approach and existing work was clarified. Finally, as suggested by the reviewers and proposed in the rebuttal, we also provide a short overview of related work on Activity-based Computing and how our system differs from that work. \  \ As discussed in the rebuttal, the section on ""approaches and concepts"" was updates to better reflect on how activity-based computing (ABC) was used in our system. Each sub-section was updated with a reference to the ABC principles it uses, thereby mapping our system directly on ABC concepts. Additionally, fig.-4, which showed an overview of the smart room, was replaced by a schematic of the ABC ontology (now fig.-3). \  \ The architecture was updated with better explanation and references to both the distributed MVC (as suggested by the reviewers) and AEXO. Footnotes were added for REST and BLIP. \  \ The evaluation section has been renamed to ""Feasibility study"" so in reflects more accurately the type of evaluation we conducted. The second evaluation question that was in the initial submission was removed and the introduction of the section now provides more details on the purpose of the study. The method section has also been separated from the participants section, to provide a better description of the exact method and motivation for a scenario-based evaluation. To clarify thetasks that has been done in scenarios, we added one scenario description (Figure 7) as an example. \  \ The discussion section was slightly updated to better reflect study results and discuss them in relation with Activity-Based Computing approach.","","design, user experience, engineering","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 20:01",""

Common approaches to authenticate a user on a mobile phone are based either on entering a PIN, a password, or drawing a pattern. However, these authentication methods are vulnerable to the shoulder surfing attack. The risk of this attack has increased since means for recording high-resolution videos are cheaply and widely accessible. If the attacker can videotape the authentication process, PINs, passwords, and patterns do not even provide the most basic level of security. In this project, we assessed the vulnerability of a magnetic gestural authentication method to the video-based shoulder surfing attack. We chose a scenario that is favourable to the attack-er. In a real world environment, we videotaped the interactions of four users performing magnetic signatures on a phone, in the presence of HD cameras from four different angles. We then recruited 22 participants and asked them to watch the videos and try to forge the signatures. The results revealed that with a certain threshold, i.e, th=1.67, none of the forging attacks was successful, whereas at this level all eligible login attempts were successfully recognized. The qualitative feedback also indicated that users found the magnetic gestural signature authentication method to be more secure than PIN-based and 2D signature methods.","1.

Arguments in environmental studies, anthropology, and other fields indicate that this transformation could begin within the next half-century. While imminent collapse is far from certain, it is prudent to consider now how to develop sociotechnical systems for use in these scenarios. We introduce the notion of collapse informatics - the study, design, and development of sociotechnical systems in the abundant present for use in a future of scarcity - as a complement to ICT4D and mitigation-oriented sustainable HCI. We draw on a variety of literatures to offer a set of relevant concepts and articulate the relationships among them to orient and evaluate collapse informatics work. Observing that collapse informatics poses a unique class of cross-cultural design problems, we sketch the design space of collapse informatics and provide a variety of example projects. We explore points of connection and distinction between collapse informatics and sustainable HCI, ICT4D, and crisis informatics. Finally, we discuss next steps and comment on the potential value of collapse informatics work even in the event that collapse never occurs.","1. Baumer, E.P.S. and Silberman, M.S.

I tried to incorporate as many improvements and clarifications as possible while working within the 4pp limit, which was challenging because the paper was fairly densely written already. \  \ * (Primary) Removed references to the video and attempted to clarify or add details for all of the points noted by reviewers as being unclear without the video. I had to do this concisely due to the space limitation so the video will still be important as a companion to this paper, but hopefully the changes make the paper read better even without viewing the video. \  \ * (Primary) Intro now includes brief characterization of casual/informal interaction. The term casual has been used less throughout, in favor of ""informal"" which is a better-studied and closely related theme (e.g. as discussed in the Voida paper [17]). \ * (Primary) minor clarifications inserted regarding links to several different notebook or document pages; and a confirmation that our intent was indeed to encourage non-linear navigation and gathering strategies. \  \ * (Primary) Slightly revised study section to clarify that users were given directed tasks (as well as the opportunity to freely explore the techniques). Also added a note there to confirm that users did respond positively to the tradeoff of relaxed precision in the scenarios we looked at. Further the description of the Frame-and-Drag-Off technique makes clear now that it supports anywhere from a single line (this is possible simply by pinching the fingers closely together) up to a couple of paragraphs. Selections that span multiple pages are not supported as of this writing. \  \ * R1: Suggestions for conciseness: the text has been tightened throughout to keep the explanations as concise as possible, while still maintaining the flow of the argument and keeping the explanations of techniques clear enough to understand what is going on without watching the video. \  \ * R2: design principle of separating pen and touch is more clearly called out and mentioned as the approach adopted by this paper, as well as an important element of what allowed us to design the techniques the way we did, building on [8]. \  \ * R2: Clarification of Pocket. Description now notes clearly this is a floating region on top of the underlying content/applications. \  \ * R2: cross referencing vs. excerpts: This is tough to spell out clearly and concisely. I attempted to do so by noting in the description of Liquid Text that it supports excerpting regions. \  \ * R3: References to video eliminated from paper. \  \ * R3: Support of deferred action, what does one do with clippings after putting them in the Pocket? Added a couple of sentences here drawing the connection between our previous works (e.g. [7,8]) and how we envision what is implemented in this system would tie into the richer set of functionality demonstrated by those systems. \  \ * R3: Post-hoc gestures very incomplete: Added a few details to this section about the type of strokes (specifications of scope) supported and what operations are supported. There are currently just a few, to demonstrate the feasibility of the idea. \  \ * R3: Pen and touch, why not just pen. Addressing design principle of pen & touch (R2) more clearly helped to address this comment as well. \  \ * R3, Courier project: We made clear that the Pocket comes from the Courier project as originally explored by Microsoft (a team that we collaborated with broadly on this line of research). \  \ * Other various small changes, such as avoiding ""encouraging"" where possible as well as the loaded term ""mutually reinforcing cycle"": all changes made to the extent possible while preserving the original intent of our paper.  \  \ Thanks again. The reviews were very helpful and provided many concrete suggestions that have improved the final presentation of the paper, I believe. We look forward to presenting the work at CHI. \  \ Ken Hinckley \ ","","design, user experience","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 16:53",""

Recent advances in smartphone technology have enabled a number of interaction techniques for smartphone that use tactile feedback to deliver navigation information. The aim is to enable eyes-free usage and avoid distracting the user from the environment. Field studies where participants had to fulfill given navigation tasks, have found these techniques to be efficient and beneficial in terms of distraction. But it is not yet clear whether these findings will replicate in in-situ usage. We, therefore, developed a Google Maps-like navigation application that incorporates interaction techniques proposed in previous work. The application was published for free on the Android Market and so people were able to use it as a navigation system in their everyday life. The data collected through anonymous monitoring suggests that tactile feedback is successfully adopted in one third of all trips and has positive effects on the user's level of distraction.","1.

In particular, cognitive tutoring systems are an example of educational technology that has been ex-tremely effective at improving mathematics learning over traditional classroom instruction. However, studies on the effectiveness of tutor software have been conducted mainly in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, and little is known about how these systems might be used in other contexts with differing classroom practices and values. To understand this question, we studied the usage of mathematics tutoring software for middle school at sites in three Latin American countries: Brazil, Mexico, and Costa Rica. While cognitive tutors were designed for individual use, we found that students in these classrooms worked collaboratively, engaging in interdependently paced work and conducting work away from their own computer. In this paper we present design recommendations for how cognitive tutors might be incorporated into different classroom practices, and better adapted for student needs in these environments.","1.

Adapting to a shifting cast of children, context and mediating activities requires CLS's to be experts at a kind of articulation work. This expertise means CLS's are well equipped to help technologists introduce child-facing interventions to the hospital. We conducted participatory design activities with 9 CLS's to develop two mobile systems to explore how CLS-child interactions are shaped by activities. We observed 18 child-CLS pairs using these systems in a hospital setting. By analyzing these encounters, we describe a continuum for classifying activities as either Co-Present or Collaborative. We then introduce a framework, Activity-Based Interaction, to describe structural components of activities that impact their position on this continuum. These concepts suggest new approaches to designing mediating technologies for adults and children.","1. Bandstra, N.F., Skinner, L., LeBlanc, C., et al.

Crowdsourcing offers an alternative approach in which an analyst pays workers to generate such explanations. Yet, asking workers with varying skills, backgrounds and motivations to simply ""Explain why a chart is interesting"" can result in irrelevant, unclear or speculative explanations of variable quality. To address these problems, we contribute seven strategies for improving the quality and diversity of worker-generated explanations. Our experiments show that using (S1) feature-oriented prompts, providing (S2) good examples, and including (S3) reference gathering, (S4) chart reading, and (S5) annotation subtasks increases the quality of responses by 28% for US workers and 196% for non-US workers. Feature-oriented prompts improve explanation quality by 69% to 236% depending on the prompt. We also show that (S6) pre-annotating charts can focus workers' attention on relevant details, and demonstrate that (S7) generating explanations iteratively increases explanation diversity without increasing worker attrition. We used our techniques to generate 910 explanations for 16 datasets, and found that 63% were of high quality. These results demonstrate that paid crowd workers can reliably generate diverse, high-quality explanations that support the analysis of specific datasets. ","1.

Unfortunately, finding these answers is still quite difficult, since users� textual queries are often incomplete, imprecise, or use different vocabularies to describe the same problem. We present LemonAid, a new approach to help that allows users to find help by instead selecting a label, widget, link, image or other user interface (UI) element that they believe is relevant to their problem. LemonAid uses this selection to retrieve previously asked questions and their corresponding answers. The key insight that makes LemonAid work is that users tend to make similar selections in the interface for similar help needs and different selections for different help needs. Our initial evaluation shows that across a corpus of dozens of tasks and thousands of requests, LemonAid retrieved a result for 90% of help requests based on UI selections and, of those, over half had relevant matches in the top 2 results.","1.

To investigate this, we asked 289 participants to retrieve 1,109 of their own active files. We analyzed the 4,948 resulting retrieval steps, i.e. moves through the hierarchical folder tree. Results show: (a) significant differences in overall retrieval time between PC and Mac that arise from different organizational strategies rather than interface design; (b) the default Windows presentation is suboptimal � if changed, retrieval time could be reduced substantially and (c) contrary to our expectations, folder depth did not affect step duration.

Informs improved folder system design by increasing efficiency in finding files.","Ofer Bergman","oferbergman@gmail.com","--Abstract-- \ * We agree with R3 and AC: the term �naturalistic setting� may be misleading because the retrieval task is controlled. We deleted the words �naturalistic setting� and point out that participants retrieved their own files from their own computers (also in the introduction and research method). \  \ --Introduction-- \ * The acronym PIM is explained. \  \ * We deleted the words ""and if so why?� from RQ1 as suggested by R2, to avoid setting up expectations regarding the focus of the research. \  \ --Results-- \ * We followed the AC�s suggestion and compared success rate between PC and Mac users (Results of a Mann-Whitney test were not significant). \  \ * We added the following text: �Table 1 shows that Mac users stored their target files higher in the hierarchical tree than PC users. Mac users also had smaller folders containing more subfolders. Our previous research [4] had shown that folder depth and size are positively correlated with retrieval time. Therefore, it seems that Mac users use a slightly different storage strategy: keeping their folders shallower and smaller than PC users, and compensating for that with broader hierarchies�. In this we (a) referred to our previous work to better explain our findings; and (b) replaced the words ""slightly more sophisticated"" with the more neutral words ""slightly different"". \  \ * We used �# of subfolders in folder� instead of �% of subfolders� as a measure of hierarchy broadness in Table 1, as R1 and R2 rightfully questioned its usage. We also corrected the typo that R2 had noticed  (writing �t=� instead of �p=�) \  \ * In agreement with R1�s recommendation we added a one-way ANOVA for Mac visual presentations. Both ANOVAs for Mac and PC were found to be significant: Ms Windows F(5,3792) = 19.08, p<0.001 and Mac F(2,408)=11.24, p<0.001. \  \ --Discussion-- \ * We agree with the AC, R1 and R2 that attempting to explain the difference in storage behavior with socio-economical difference is highly speculative and refrained from doing that. Instead we left it for future research. \  \ * We thank the AC for the excellent idea of comparing file navigation to physical navigation. We added the following: �A more interesting possibility is that users see navigation paths as single conceptual entity, rather than consisting of a combination of elements broken down into each of the folders along the paths. This may be similar to physical navigation in which some (typically new) paths are remembered as a combination of turning points, while other (typically more familiar) paths may be remembered as a single entity (e.g. �the way home�).� \   \ * We added a more specific suggestion for future research with design implementations: �Controlled research involving eye tracking should investigate why some presentations lead to shorter duration time by manipulating file icons size, spatial order and the details of information added to them. These studies could in turn, lead to an informed design of new presentations with shorter retrieval time.� \  \ --References-- \ As the reviewers noticed we accidently used the wrong EndNote style. We corrected that and straightened out all relevant mistakes.  \  \ --Additional Changes--- \ As the AC suggested that the paper may possibly compete for the best note award we had sent the text to professional word proof.","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 24 00:02",""

Previous interventions have produced promising results, but have typically focused on domestic energy consumption. By contrast, this paper focuses on the workplace context, which presents very different opportunities and challenges. For instance, financial consequences, which have proved successful as motivations in the domestic environment, are not present in the workplace in the context of employees. We describe the outcome of a sequence of workshops that focussed on understanding employee perceptions of energy use in the workplace, with the locus of activity on energy intervention design. Using a grounded theory analysis, we produced a framework of key themes detailing user perceptions and energy intervention design considerations. Our findings provide a framework of considerations for the design of successful workplace energy interventions. ","1. 1E PC Energy Report (2009).

In terms of security, they are rather weak since the shapes are easy to steal and reproduce. In this work, we introduce an implicit authentication approach that enhances password patterns with an additional security layer, transparent to the user. In short, users are not only authenticated by the shape they input but also by the way they perform the input. We conducted two consecutive studies, a lab and a long-term study, using Android applications to collect and log data from user input on a touch screen of standard commercial smartphones. Analyses using dynamic time warping (DTW) provided first proof that it is actually possible to distinguish different users and use this information to increase security of the input while keeping the convenience for the user high.","1.

Stereoscopic 3D graphics promise a better gaming experience but this potential has not yet been proven empirically. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study that evaluates player experience of three stereoscopic games in comparison with their monoscopic counterparts. We examined 60 participants, each playing one of the three games, using three self-reporting questionnaires and one psychophysiological instrument. Our main results are (1) stereoscopy in games increased experienced immersion, spatial presence, and simulator sickness; (2) the effects strongly differed across the three games and for both genders, indicating more affect on male users and with games involving depth animations; (3) results related to attention and cognitive involvement indicate more direct and less thoughtful interactions with stereoscopic games, pointing towards a more natural experience through stereoscopy.","1.

We believe that the sense of personal agency is a key factor in how people experience interactions with technology. This paper draws on theoretical perspectives in cognitive neuroscience and describes two implicit methods through which personal agency can be empirically investigated. We report two experiments applying these methods to HCI problems. One shows that a new input modality - skin-based interaction - can substantially increase users' sense of agency. The second demonstrates that variations in the parameters of assistance techniques such as predictive mouse acceleration can have a significant impact on users' sense of agency. The methods presented provide designers with new ways of evaluating and refining empowering interaction techniques and interfaces, in which users experience an instinctive sense of control and ownership over their actions.","1.

Fleming","Scott.Fleming@memphis.edu","Information Foraging Theory (IFT) has established itself as an important theory to explain how people seek information, but most work has focused more on the theory itself than on how best to apply it. In this paper, we investigate how to apply a reactive variant of IFT (Reactive IFT) to design IFT-based tools, with a special focus on such tools for ill-structured problems. Toward this end, we designed and implemented a variety of recommender algorithms to empirically investigate how to help people with the ill-structured problem of finding where to look for information while debugging source code. We varied the algorithms based on scent type supported (words alone vs. words + code structure), and based on use of foraging momentum to estimate rapidity of foragers' goal changes. Our empirical results showed that (1) using both words and code structure significantly improved the ability of the algorithms to recommend where software developers should look for information; (2) participants used recommendations to discover new places in the code and also as shortcuts to navigate to known places; and (3) low-momentum recommendations were significantly more useful than high-momentum recommendations, suggesting rapid and numerous goal changes in this type of setting. Overall, our contributions include two new recommendation algorithms, empirical evidence about when and why participants found IFT-based recommendations useful, and implications for the design of tools based on Reactive IFT. \ ","1.

Details follow. \  \ * Make connections among the different parts of the paper clearer. \ Response: To address this point, we clarified at several points in the paper that the study was not summative (i.e., to validate a system), but rather formative (i.e., investigating a variety of possible design decisions along 2 dimensions for Reactive IFT-based tools). We also moved our operationalizations of the theory _inside_ the Empirical Method section to make clearer that the purpose of the operationalizations was to implement different ""treatments"" to investigate. Finally, we added/edited connective text throughout the paper to make the connections clearer. \  \ * Provide better introduction and description of their previous works (e.g., PFIS2, PFIS3). \ Response: We added text to the Background section (esp. the last paragraph) to address this point. We also edited the descriptions of the algorithms for clarity. \  \ * Better motivate the current study. \ Response: We edited the introduction to address this point. \  \ * Describe how the contribution of the current study goes over and beyond our previous works. \ Response: We edited the Background and Conclusion sections to explicitly address this point. We changed the algorithm names to PFIS-R and TFIDF-R to make explicit that they are new variants for this paper (designed especially for our empirical needs), based on but not exactly the same as PFIS2 and PFIS3.   \  \ * Clearly state the contribution of the paper. \ Response: We addressed this point by rewriting the abstract and explicitly stating the contribution in the introduction and conclusion. \  \ * Describe limitations of the study. \ Response: We added limitations in the discussion subsections ""Sensitivity to Momentum"" and ""Beyond Word Cues"". \  \ * Provide practical guidelines for the CHI community. \ Response: We reworked the General Discussion section to bring out the implications of our results. and renamed it ""Discussion: Implications and Open Questions"" \  \ ------- In addition, we also made the changes promised in our rebuttal, namely: \  \ * Explain why we were comparing PFIS to TF-IDF. \ Response: We added explanatory text to the section ""Recommendation Algorithms Considered"". \  \ * Explain delta and how it relates to momentum. \ Response: Addressed in the section ""Recommendation Algorithms Considered"". \  \ * Explain that the low-momentum results are surprising. \ Response: Addressed in the final discussion section. \  \ * Clarify the need for tie-breaking. \ Response: We added clarifications in both the algorithms section and the hit-rate results section. \  \ * Clarify how were recommendations divided between new and visited locations. \ Response: Addressed in the algorithms section. \  \ * Make other detailed clarifications changes requested by the reviewers. \ Response: We changed the title, modified the figures, and generally edited the paper for clarity as per the original reviewer comments. \  \ We thank everyone for their time and attention, and look forward to hearing from you. \  \ Sincerely, \ Scott Fleming \ Corresponding Author \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 22 12:58",""

Highlights design spaces for aspects of personhood, intimacy, sense of self and home in dementia. \ ","Jayne Wallace","jayne.wallace@northumbria.ac.uk","To clarify our contribution, we have added detail to the introduction explicitly itemizing the contributions of the work. \ The introduction text has been altered to include the following final paragraph: \ �This paper centers on understanding users in the extreme context of severe dementia within a hospital setting. We highlight dynamics and challenges in the hospital setting that were revealed through the use of the art piece, which help us to understand severe dementia and staff-client exchanges more holistically. We reveal nuanced and multi-textured aspects of what it means to have severe dementia and the themes of personhood, intimacy, sense of self and home are shown to enable a rich understanding of this context and how this can help us to design in this environment. We highlight spaces for design to make a positive difference and show how understanding users can inform sensitive empathic design. We suggest that a designer should step back from constraints emphasizing the institutional environment or cognitive impairment and instead focus on enabling the full person.� \  \ We acknowledged a lack of self-critique in our methodology. In response to reviewer comments, we have clarified our methodology and its limitations and the xxx section has been altered as follows: \ �As part of a service evaluation for the art piece, we conducted semi-structured interviews with members of staff in the unit, including 2 ward managers, 1 occupational therapist, 1 auxiliary and 7 qualified staff nurses. Interviews were conducted on the day of installation, and in months 1 and 3, lasted on average 30 minutes and were audio recorded, transcribed and analyzed in-depth by following Braun and Clarke�s thematic analysis approach [6]. We asked staff about their experiences and observations of using the piece with clients and adopted the most ethical approach that we could in this context: one that added no additional burden for clients. Clients in the unit have extremely challenging and complex behaviors and the staff group, who have a very person-centered form of care working one-to-one with clients were perfectly positioned to act as client advocates to give us feedback over the prolonged period of use that formed our evaluation.� \  \ We have also added more information concerning the disorders of clients in the unit and the duration of a clients� stay: \ THE PUBLIC ART COMMISSION \ The art piece Tales of I came into being through a public art commission for a specific care and treatment unit (which we will refer to as Francis Place) in a new annex of a hospital in the UK. Francis Place is a secure unit for up to 16 clients with psychiatric disorders (predominantly severe dementia) and mainly accommodates male clients. The unit specializes in the assessment and treatment of these clients, who are usually transferred from care homes following extreme changes in their presentation or displays of anti-social behavior. A client�s stay in the unit ranges typically from two to four weeks depending on each specific diagnosis and treatment. \  \ R3 suggested that our paper would be improved by the inclusion of additional related literature. We have adjusted the text to include Gaver et al.�s Prayer Companion as well as a selection of significant pieces of digital jewellery, which for anonymity we had not added in the original text. \  \ Fresh inclusions:  \ 12.

The familiarity of pen and paper makes it a particularly attractive media for many user groups, including young children. Digital pens enhance interaction with traditional paper content by playing and recording audio and recognizing handwriting and gestures. Currently, generating custom interactive paper documents involves some programming, limiting its use by many user groups (e.g., educators and families) who might especially benefit from application of hybrid paper-digital interfaces in their practices. To address this need, we developed an end-user Toolkit for Authoring Pen and Paper Language Activities (TAP & PLAY). This paper describes the iterative development of the toolkit, its accessibility for novice non-technical users, and use in three different contexts for early language learning. We demonstrate and document the system's usability, generality, and utility for people who want to create and tailor their own custom interactive paper-based language activities.","1.

The system replaces an existing kitchen refuse bin and automatically logs disposed of items through digital images captured by a smart phone installed on the underside of the bin lid. Captured images are uploaded to a BinCam application on Facebook where they can be explored by all users of the BinCam system. Engagement with BinCam is designed to fit into the existing structure of users' everyday life, with the intention that reflection on waste and recycling becomes a playful and shared group activity. Results of a user study reveal an increase in both users' awareness of, and reflection about, their waste management and their motivation to improve their waste-related skills. With BinCam, we also explore informational and normative social influences as a source of change (e.g., socially evoked feelings of 'guilt' for non-recycling or food disposal), which has to date been underexplored in persuasive HCI.

Suggestions for employing social media and enabling social influence to promote change are provided.","Anja Thieme","anja.thieme@ncl.ac.uk","The following outlines the changes made to the submission as suggested in the reviews, the author's rebuttal and the post-rebuttal meta-review. \  \ Improve the Discussion of the System's Evaluation \  \ As suggested in the rebuttal, we added detail to the methodology to clarify the procedure of the system evaluation. On the bottom of page 5 we included that the focus groups lasted ""on average 51 min (min = 40, max = 77)"" and that ""We found post-study focus groups to be less intrusive than regular observations or diary keeping, while very suitable for our research purpose to study BinCam in shared households of individuals' living and experiencing the system together.""  \ We further specified that we conducted two initial visits: one to assess the recycling facilities of each household, and a second one, two weeks later to employ the BinCam bin, to hand out the pre-study questionnaire and to introduce the BinCam application on Facebook. \  \ On page 9, we now acknowledge the limitations of collected self-report data and take up a stance on the focus group methodology. We included: ""Above all, our results are solely based on individuals' self-reports in focus groups. We found however that participants responded equally and were notably uninhibited to share personal feelings of guilt or of being observed by others."" (page 9). \  \  \ Articulation of the Design Limitations \   \ The limitations of the BinCam design are now more clearly articulated throughout the discussion section.  \  \ With regard to informational social influence, we now acknowledge on page 8 (bottom) the provocative nature of the BinCam system itself (as suggested by R3). We added: ""It has to be acknowledged, however, that reflection is not only motivated by the factors outlined in Table 1, but evoked through the provocative character of the system itself. In foregrounding waste, something that usually falls in oblivion once it is discarded, it increases awareness and invites reflection"". We further clarified our lessons learned and design suggestions for future systems: ""To promote informational social influence, we suggest that designs provide frequent feedback (e.g. daily instead of weekly) as well as diverse visualizations and opportunities for comparisons of own and others' behavioral data.""  \  \ To articulate design limitations with regard to the wrongly tagged BinPictures and the visualizations of the BinLeague, we adapted: ""While captured information about a person's behavior should be accurate and reliable, their presentation design seems equally important for it to be understandable to users. The BinLeague presents through tree and gold graphics an abstract and highly simplified view of users' collective recycling achievements and food savings, both further limited due to incorrect taggings of collected BinPictures using AMT. This explains why some users were confused or dissatisfied about the league and its visualization. Yet, others were still able to make sense of the league. They reflected and discussed with their housemates how the graphics relate to their behavior, and felt motivated to improve"" (top of page 8). \  \ Regarding normative social influence (page 8), the first sentence already stated: ""Overall the normative social influence in BinCam was not as salient as expected"". We then made clearer that ""This may be explained by a lack of group coherence in the participating houses and their engagement with the BinCam App. It may also relate to the fact that an individual's contribution to the household's waste was not perceived to be associated with the receipt of social rewards nor to pose a real threat from housemates for non-compliance (i.e. as compared to the council)."" As a learned design lesson, we now suggest in a subsequent section that ""to support group coherence, the interaction with the systems should be more strongly designed as a group activity""; and raise questions such as: ""How can design facilitate the creation of a team identity around each bin? How would the social dynamics in BinCam change if participants of all households knew each other from the outset?"" \  \ Discussion of Ethical Issues \  \ The revised paper engages more substantively with ethical issues of BinCam (see comments of R1, R4) . To this end, we specified our discussion of guilt as behavioural motivator. On page 9 we write: ""Feelings of guilt or shame in BinCam, however were not directly evoked through the system or external pressures of others observing, but primarily based on an internal evaluation resulting from users' increased awareness of the discrepancy between their own perceived and ideal behavior."" \  \ The revised paper also addresses privacy issues more deeply (as requested by R1, R3). We added two sentences at the beginning of the results section (top of page 6) explaining that ""three participants stated that they dislike the idea to be monitored in every aspect of their life and although they generally did not mind if somebody saw pictures of their waste, they wouldn't want the council to see them. These privacy concerns, however, were not associated with their temporary participation in the BinCam project, which was both self-chosen and liked."" \  \ The privacy topic is taken on again in the discussion of ethical concerns where we now state (on page 9): ""Furthermore, and considering the privacy concerns raised, BinCam should be regarded as playful reflection stimulating intervention that finds temporarily acceptance in peoples' lives, if users remain in control of their data and know to whom it is visible. It is neither an obscure monitoring device nor to be used by third parties"". \  \  \ Other Improvements \  \ To eliminate confusion about the nature of 'Jetsam' as the augmented trashcan of Paulos and Jenkins, we changed the sentence introducing this related work to: ""The augmented trashcan Jetsam [23] is a public city trashcan that projects a visualization of collected trash items to urban dwellers on the street"" (see page 3). \  \ Made changes improved and replace previous text or sections. In addition, we made the paper more concise throughout to create space for the inclusion of additional valuable information. \ ","","design, sustainability","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 16:39",""

We first describe the principle of MUSTARD and then examine various functions that can be used to minimize crosstalk between multiple viewer positions.

MRP systems are physically embodied mobile videoconferencing systems that remote co-workers control. These systems allow remote users, pilots, to actively initiate conversations and to navigate throughout the local environment. To investigate ways of encouraging team-like behavior among local and remote co-workers, we conducted a 2 (visual framing: decoration vs. no decoration) x 2 (verbal framing: interdependent vs. independent performance scoring) between-participants study (n=40). We hypothesized that verbally framing the situation as interdependent and visually framing the MRP system to create a sense of self-extension would enhance group cohesion between the local and the pilot. We found that the interdependent framing was successful in producing more in-group oriented behaviors and, contrary to our predictions, visual framing of the MRP system weakened team cohesion. \ ","WARNING: Reference 41 is very long.

In particular, we have made the following major improvements based on the meta-review and comments from other reviewers: \ 1.	We have made improvements in the flow of the layout of the text and numerous clarifications in language and descriptions. These improvements include: \ a.	Rewrite of the hypotheses, focusing on clarifying what is meant by �group identity� and �feelings of group membership;� \ b.	Rewrite of the study methodology to improve clarity; \ c.	Rewrite of the experimental approach; \ d.	Renaming of �personalization� to �visual framing through self-extension;� \ e.	Addition of related work that guided our experimental design (i.e., Nass et al., 1996); \ f.	Clarification on the choices regarding visual framing manipulation, in particular discussed the tradeoffs the level of personalization brings;  \ g.	An explanation for controlling for video-gaming experience; \ h.	Changes to the section layout for the procedure and methodology to improve clarity;  \ i.	Addition of information on the development of the questionnaire and how it was assessed for reliability and validity; \ j.	A discussion of the limitations imposed by the lack of rigorous qualitative results. \ 2.	We have significantly extended the information on the pre-test and the basis for the selection of the experimental task. More specifically, these changes include: \ a.	More detail on the pre-test process; \ b.	How the six framing manipulations in the pre-test were chosen; \ c.	The metrics we used for evaluation; \ d.	Clarification on how we carried out the pre-test trials; \ e.	More discussion on how the pre-test informed the development of final manipulations and helped us test the experimental procedure; \ i.	An explanation of why some items in the Desert Survival Task were removed and why a time limit was put on the task; \ ii.	More detail on how the disclosure questions were used; \ iii.	A description of how the pilot screen was presented to the participants. \ 3.	We have provided more information on how we developed our experimental task and manipulations, including: \ a.	More detailed description of prior work that informed our experimental design (i.e., Nass et al., 1996); \ b.	Discussion on how the Desert Survival Task has been tested for reliability and validity; \ c.	An explanation of how the Desert Survival Task has been used as a measure of team alignment and agreement in related work. \ 4.	We have improved the discussion on the implications of our study for research and design. Particular improvements include: \ a.	A discussion of how outcomes such as learning, motivation, and rapport might be improved in remote learning and spontaneous communication for mobility challenged individuals; \ b.	More discussion on the design implications of our research; \ c.	More discussion on how our results might inform future research. \ 5.	Finally, we have made other improvements in presentation such as:  \ a.	Reconsideration and rearrangement of all figures; \ b.	Improvements in cross-references in the text as well as the bibliography; \ c.	A complete proofreading of the paper. \ Attached to this letter is the revised paper, we hope that this revision addresses all the concerns highlighted by the reviewers and the editors. However, we will also be happy to make further changes, as seen necessary by the paper shepherd.  \ Thank you for your time and consideration! \ Best regards, \  \ Irene Rae, Leila Takayama, and Bilge Mutlu \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 23:56",""

As a forum for sharing news and discussing events, it can provide instant access to the latest updates, but this is not always welcome. In the case of television shows or live sporting events, for example, tweets about them may reveal spoilers to users in different time zones or who are delaying their viewing until later. More broadly, because Twitter is a broadcast medium, users may often want to temporarily or permanently hide content about a very specific given topic.  \  \ In this paper, we describe the unique challenges to HCI, social computing, and computational linguistics  posed by the task of building an interface that blocks all tweets about a specific event or topic. We illustrate some of the challenges through a pilot experiment run for three major television events: the 2009 NFC Championship football game, the 2010 mid-season finale of the show Glee, and the 2010 season premiere of the show 24. While simple techniques achieve very high recall (>98%), spoilers still make it through the filter and precision is extremely poor. We conclude with a description of challenges to the community in implementing this new and increasingly important feature. \ ","1. Golbeck, J., Grimes, J., and Rogers, A.

Specifically, we implement Grossman and Balakrishnan�s Bubble Cursor, the fastest general pointing facilitation technique in the literature. Our implementation obtains the necessary knowledge of interface targets using a combination of pixel-level analysis and social annotation. We discuss the most novel aspects of our implementation, including methods for interactive creation and correction of pixel-level prototypes of interface elements and methods for interactive annotation of how the cursor should select identified elements. We also report on limitations of the Bubble Cursor unearthed by examining our implementation in the complexity of real-world interfaces. We therefore contribute important progress toward real-world deployment of an important family of techniques and shed light on the gap between understanding techniques in controlled settings versus behavior with real-world interfaces.","1.

Tools intended to improve color differentiability (recoloring tools) exist, but these all use abstract models of only a few types of congenital CVD; if the user�s color problems have a different cause, existing recolorers can perform poorly. We have developed a recoloring tool (SSMRecolor) based on the idea of situation-specific modeling � in which we build a performance-based model of a particular user in their specific environment, and use that model to drive the recoloring process. SSMRecolor covers a much wider range of CVDs, including acquired and situational deficiencies. We evaluated SSMRecolor and two existing tools in a controlled study of people�s color-matching performance in several environmental conditions. The study included participants with and without congenital CVD. Our results show both accuracy and response time in color-matching tasks were significantly better with SSMRecolor. This work demonstrates the value of a situation-specific approach to recoloring, and shows that this technique can substantially improve the usability of color displays for users of all types.","1.

Gaze cues are particularly important to achieve significant high-level outcomes such as improved learning and feelings of rapport. Our goal is to explore how agents might achieve such outcomes through seemingly subtle changes in gaze behavior and what design variables for gaze might lead to such positive outcomes. Drawing on research in human physiology, we developed a model of gaze behavior to capture these key design variables. In a user study, we investigated how manipulations in these variables might improve affiliation with the agent and learning. The results showed that an agent using affiliative gaze elicited more positive feelings of connection, while an agent using referential gaze improved participants' learning. Our model and findings offer guidelines for the design of effective gaze behaviors for virtual agents.","1. Argyle, M., and Cook, M. Gaze and mutual gaze.

We have therefore provided a more comprehensive specification of the model in the paper, particularly how head and eye angles are specified throughout a gaze shift based on input parameters such as the agent's ocular-motor range and head alignment. We are also creating an online project webpage which includes even more details of the model and study, including documented source code of our implementation, character animations, and questionnaires used in the study. This webpage is linked to in the paper. These changes can be found in  the ""Designing Effective Gaze Mechanisms"" section.

While virtual possessions have become ubiquitous, little work exists to inform designers on how these growing collections should be displayed and how they should behave. We generated four design concepts that changed the form and behavior of these digital things, making them more present within a teen bedroom. We then conducted speed dating sessions to investigate how these new forms and behaviors influence perceptions of value. Sessions revealed how new technologies might better support self-exploration and reflection, as well as how they could complicate identity construction processes. Findings are interpreted to detail opportunities and tensions that can guide future research and practice in this emerging space. ","1.	Ackerman, M., Mainwaring, S. 2005.

Although exceedingly simple in their output - varying light intensity over time - their design space can be rich. Unfortunately, a survey of contemporary uses revealed that the vocabulary of lighting expression in popular use today is small, fairly unimaginative, and generally ambiguous in meaning. In this paper, we work through a structured design process that points the way towards a much richer set of expressive forms and more effective communication for this very simple medium. In this process, we make use of five different data gathering and evaluation components to leverage the knowledge, opinions and expertise of people outside our team. Our work starts by considering what information is typically conveyed in this medium. We go on to consider potential expressive forms - how information might be conveyed. We iteratively refine and expand these sets, concluding with ideas gathered from a panel of designers. Our final step was to make use of thousands of human judgments, gathered in a crowd-sourced fashion (265 participants), to measure the suitability of different expressive forms for conveying different information content. This results in a set of recommended light behaviors that mobile devices, such as smartphones, could readily employ.","1. Amazon Mechanical Turk. http://www.mturk.com \ 2.

In this paper we provide an in-depth analysis of how the news broke and spread on Twitter. We confirm the claim that Twitter broke the news first, and find evidence that Twitter had convinced a large number of its audience before mainstream media confirmed the news. We also discover that attention on Twitter was highly concentrated on a small number of ""opinion leaders"" and identify three groups of opinion leaders who played key roles in spreading the news: individuals affiliated with media played a large part in breaking the news, mass media brought the news to a wider audience and provided eager Twitter users with content on external sites, and celebrities helped to spread the news and stimulate conversation. Our findings suggest Twitter has great potential as a news medium.","1. Breaking Bin Laden. http://blog.socialflow.com/post/5246404319/ breaking-bin-laden-visualizing-the-power-of-a-single. \ 2.

Modeling the process of human adaptation to agents is important for designing intelligent interface agents and adaptive user interfaces that learn a user's preferences and behavior strategy. However, few studies on human adaptation to such an agent have been done. We propose a human adaptation model for a two-player game. We prepared an on-line experimental system in which a participant and an agent play a repeated penny-matching game with a bonus round. We then conducted experiments in which different opponent agents (human or robot) change their strategy during the game.  The experimental results indicated that, as expected, there is an adaptation phase when a human is confronted with a change in the opponent agent's strategy, and adaptation is faster when a human is competing with robot than with another human.","1.

The section DISCUSSION is mainly revised. The revisions are as follows: \  \ 1) Between participants' variability \ We added the following sentences as the second paragraph of the section DISCUSSION.  \  \ ""There are two causes for the gradual increase in the winning percentage in the adaptation phase: 1) Each participant changed \ his/her strategy just once in the adaptation phase (during games 5 to 7) and the timings of the changes varied across the participants. 2) Each participant changed his/her strategy plural times to find the most suitable strategy. To investigate these causes, we compared the number of strategy changes in the adaptation phase in two conditions. The average number of strategy changes by the participants was 1.07 under an ""against robot"" condition and 1.57 under an ""against human"" condition was 1.57, so there was a marginally significant difference (t(26) = 1.919, p = 0.066).  This suggests that strategy changes by the participants were one-shot deterministic under an ""against robot"" condition bat indecisive and exploratory under an ""against human"" condition."" \  \ 2) Interpretation of the drop of winning percentage \ We added the following sentences as the third paragraph of the section DISCUSSION.  \  \ ""We consider the drop of winning percentage in the eighth game could be accounted for by meta-adaptation. Our game design requires at least two levels to be adapted. The first is adaptation for regularity of the agent's choice in the first five rounds. The second is adaptation for strategy change in the fourth game. The third, which was beyond our expectations, is an adaptation for periodic change in an agent's strategy. Participants might think the agent's strategy changes once every three games and so expect to change again in the seventh game."" \  \ 3) Statistical values are added to Table 2. \  \ 4) Descriptions of Experimental setup are improved by adding a sentence ""Before the main experiment, all participants played five games only for training."" so that readers correctly understand the experimental procedure. \  \ 5) We modified the paper title. \ Old: Experimental Investigation of Human Adaptation to Change in Agent Strategy in Competitive Two-Player Game \  \ New: Experimental Investigation of Human Adaptation to Change in Agent's Strategy through a Competitive Two-Player Game","","design, engineering, games","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 08:55",""

The rationale is the following: the previous names are good names from an InfoVis (or Computer Graphics) perspective, but for CHI it is be better to use names that map more directly to the user experience. The three new names encode the view of the user on the panorama, rather than the shape of the visualization. We therefore regard them to be more appropriate for CHI than the previous names. \  \  \ As requested by reviewers, we added details to various sections of the paper: \  \ * We explicitely explain the reasons for our choices on the apparatus, separating them from the experimental design in the ""Pilot study"" section:  \  \ ""To isolate and accurately measure comparative performance with the visualizations, we chose a controlled lab setup. [...] We used a wand to acquire accurate motion and timing data via an infrared tracker."" \  \ * We added details on the expertise of participants. To be concise, we added the details at the end of the ""Pilot study"" section, referring to all three user studies: \  \ ""During the three experiments, we collected questionnaire data on expertise with panoramas (browsing, capturing), maps and games (radars, 3D graphics). Expertise was balanced within the participants."" \  \ * We deepened the discussion of the three experiments with more qualitative results on pros/cons of the three shapes: \  \ USER STUDY 1: ""Participants reported imagining themselves �in the middle of the visualization� for Top-Down and Bird�s Eye. For Frontal, more �thinking� with respect to body-alignment was required."" \  \ USER STUDY 2: this section already had an extensive qualitative section. \  \ USER STUDY 3: ""In the interviews, reported strategies and issues with Bird�s Eye were in line with study 2. Figure 3 (right) illustrates that Bird�s Eye was again slower than Top-Down and Frontal mostly in the warped areas. Participants reported that Frontal was the easiest to find the pitch of points, whereas finding the yaw was considered harder. With Top-Down, participants had issues with the outermost third of the visualization (high pitch in the panorama), due to the strong distortion effect."" \  \  \ We clarified unclear terminology: \  \ * We removed all occurrences of ""Relative time difference"" in the 3 results sections. \  \ * We defined readability on page 1: ""If we use the term readability qualitatively, as the ease of reading panorama elements, rectangles offer good readability of the panorama but do not clearly represent the fact that the environment surrounds the user [...]"" \  \  \ Finally, we did a few more minor changes: \  \ * We de-anonymized all references to our previous work (reference [5]). \  \ * We added thumbnail images to the legends in Figure 3, to ease the reading of the three conditions. \  \ * We re-worded a few sentences throughout the paper, to fit again the 4 pages.

We seek to guide UI design based on the tangential force applied by a user to the surface of a hand-held device. A prototype of an interface using tangential force input was implemented utilizing a force sensitive layer and an elastic layer and used for the user experiment. We investigated user controllability to reach and maintain target force levels and considered the effects of hand pose and direction of force input. Our results imply no significant difference in performance when applying force holding the device in one hand and in two hands. We also observed that users have more physical and perceived loads when applying tangential force in the left-right direction compared to the up-down direction. Based on the experimental results, we discuss considerations for user interface applications of tangential-force-based interface.","1.Accot, J., Zhai, Z., Beyond Fitts' law: models for trajectory-based HCI tasks.

In particular, systems used in several recent experiments provided information about others' current activities so that their availability for conversation could be assessed, and interruptions could be timed strategically. One issue with these experimental systems, though, is that many do not notify the observed party that these observations are taking place. There is reason to believe that such notification could be valuable to users, and that it could alter observers' behavior. Moreover, factors such as the perceived urgency of the interruption could affect willingness to violate social norms in gathering information. We report on an experiment assessing the impact of perceived visibility and task urgency on awareness checking behavior. Results suggest that people check more often when they believe their partners do not know they are checking, and more often when the task is time-constrained than when it is not.","1. Allen, T. J.

To explore the types of conversations that are shared on the community web forum, we conducted a qualitative study. We analyzed 865 forum posts from a community crime web forum from April 2004 to June 2011. We found that residents use the forum to: 1) build relationships by strengthening social ties, 2) discuss ways to take collective action, 3) share information and advice, and 4) regulate the social norms of the neighborhood and the web forum. Results suggest that technologies intended for crime prevention should be designed to support communication and problem-solving discussions amongst residents, as opposed to simply providing information to citizens.","1.

However, children's input and ideas require careful interpretation to reach viable designs and technical specifications, which poses a significant challenge to an adult design research team. In this paper we discuss our approach to managing the complexity of combining concepts and ideas that were generated through participatory design work with the practical, technical, ethical and theoretical constraints of developing a technologically enhanced learning environment for children with and without Autism Spectrum Conditions. We found that the nature of this design problem did not lend itself to be rationally reduced to produce a single solution, but required an understanding of interpretive and speculative approaches for us to be able to cope with the complexity of requirements. We describe a workshop in which members of the design team used such approaches to develop a design brief that is faithful to the children's input. By making this process transparent, we aim to contribute to the methodology of using such designerly approaches in combination with participatory and human-centred methods to develop interactive technology.","1.

In our experiment participants were first asked to provide their preferences between pairs of items. They were then asked to make second choices about the same pairs with knowledge of others' preferences. Our results show that others people's opinions significantly sway people's own choices. The influence is stronger when people are required to make their second decision sometime later (22.4%) than immediately (14.1%). Moreover, people seem to be most likely to reverse their choices when facing a moderate, as opposed to large, number of opposing opinions. Finally, the time people spend making the first decision significantly predicts whether they will reverse their decisions later on, while demographics such as age and gender do not. These results have implications for consumer behavior research as well as online marketing strategies. ","1. Asch, S.E. (1956) Studies of independence and conformity: I.

We discuss some of the key analyses of affordances in HCI research and make three related claims. First, we argue that many current interpretations of the concept are essentially incompatible with Gibson. Second, we hold that the Gibsonian concept of affordances, conceptualized as interaction between animals and their environments, provides some important insights, but is, in the end, of limited relevance to HCI research. Third, we call for adopting a mediated action perspective on affordances as an alternative to Gibson's ecological psychology. We outline a view of technology affordances as possibilities for human action mediated by cultural means conceived as a relational property of a three-way interaction between the person, mediational means, and environment. We conclude with a discussion of prospects for future conceptual and empirical explorations of the meditational perspective in HCI research.","WARNING: Reference 28 starts with a non-alphanumeric character.

We identify the potential benefits of uncomfortable interactions under the general headings of entertainment, enlightenment and sociality. We then review artworks and performances that have employed discomfort, including two complementary examples from the worlds of entertainment and performance. From this, we articulate a suite of tactics for designing four primary forms of discomfort referred to as visceral, cultural, control and intimate.  We discuss how moments of discomfort need to be embedded into an overall experience which requires a further consideration of the dramatic acts of exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and d�nouement. Finally, we discuss an ethical framework for uncomfortable interactions which leads us to revisit key issues of consent, withdrawal, privacy and risk.","1.

The ability to record and share such data has created a critical moment in the practice and scope of behavioral research. While recent work is beginning to develop techniques for visualizing and interacting with integrated multimodal information collected during field research, navigating and analyzing these large datasets remains challenging and tools are especially needed to support the early stages of data exploration. \  \ In this paper we describe digital pen and paper practices in observational research and their integration with ChronoViz, a tool for annotating, visualizing, and analyzing multimodal data. The goal is to better support researchers both in the field, while collecting data, and later in the lab, during analysis.  We document the co-evolution of notetaking practices and system features as 28 participants used the tool during an 18-month deployment. ","1.

We apply a naturalistic and longitudinal logs-based approach to collect real usage data from 24 iPhone users in the wild. These data are used to describe smartphone usage and analyze revisitation patterns of web browsers, native applications, and physical locations where phones are used. Among our findings are that web page revisitation through browsers occurred very infrequently (approximately 25% of URLs are revisited by each user), bookmarks were used sparingly, physical traversing patterns mirrored virtual (internet) traversing patterns and users systematically differed in their web use. We characterize these differences and suggest ways to support users with enhanced design of smartphone technologies and content. ","1. Abowd, G.D. & Mynatt, E.D.

We are delighted that our paper was conditionally accepted for publication in CHI and confident that the attached manuscript addresses all of the major concerns highlighted in the review. In our opinion, the current version of the paper is substantially better than the previous version because of the tremendous feedback we received in the reviews. Given the concerns of the associate chair regarding the loss of important information in the revision, the below bullets include what we have both removed and added in the current manuscript.  \  \ In order to make space for content promised in the rebuttal, several actions were taken: \  \ - A few of the older and less-relevant PC web studies were removed from the Background section \ - The figures in the previous manuscript were combined to allow for comparisons; additionally, we integrated added content within previous figures instead of creating new ones \ - We created a substantial amount of space by using an acronym for �native internet applications�, which was a term we spelled out and used quite frequently in the previous manuscript \ - Numerous wording refinements  \ - The restructuring of the paper revealed a few short sections that were highly repetitive and, thus, we were able to remove some of this content    \  \ We verified that almost all of the data from the previous version of the paper is still within the revision along with the important additions outlined below. Additionally, the restructuring of the paper presents a much more organized paper, in our opinion, instead of a potpourri of findings. We align our bullets describing the additions with the meta-review comments: \  \ - Our research interests are now explicit in the Introduction section, reiterated implicitly at the end of the Background section and then tied back up again in the conclusion.  \ - We also provide much more user interview data to better ground the quantitative results and the Discussion section was completely rewritten and tied to previous research to present more concrete arguments. Additionally, instead of referring to users at different ends of the app-to-site index, we use anchor names to better ground results and organize design implications.  \ - The design implications were updated substantially and more aligned with the goals of our study and differences we found between our users \ - Our methodology is now described more clearly and includes relevant details that were not in the first version of the paper. For instance, we now present how we incentivized participants, the gender balance and also discuss the methodology later in the paper. Again, this is a clear strength of our paper because of the deliberately naturalistic and longitudinal methodology we used to collect the data. Because we explore users for one year, we can assess experience instead of ignore it.  \ - We were able to add most of the references mentioned by Reviewer #2 \ - Finally, we think the novelty of our work has substantially increased due to the additions of the location data, better comparisons with previous studies, clearer statements of contributions and grounding, the type of sites and native internet apps (NIAs) visited. All of which allowed us to describe more stable differences between users and targeted design recommendations that are updated.  \  \ Again, we are extremely appreciative of all reviews and think these were  essential to making this revision substantially better.

Here we respond to the issues raised by the reviewers and point to specific changes in the text. The first eight items correspond to our rebuttal while the rest address other issues raised by the reviewers. \  \ 1. Test participants were naive laypersons with no specific domain knowledge \  \ The last two paragraphs of the discussion better clarify that our setup is an approximation of real analysis that enables us to collect sufficient data for quantitative testing. A study of this magnitude (size of task, multiple sessions) with real domain experts would have been difficult to organize. \  \ 2. The studied dataset is small and thus atypical of real scientific datasets \  \ The penultimate paragraph of the discussion section positions our experimental task between real analysis and small experimental setups that can generate quantifiable results.  \  \ The last paragraph clarifies that our focus was not the exploratory process inherent to real analysis but how users aggregate evidence once they find it. We believe our setup brought out the deliberative aspect of analysis and made results easier to compare. \  \ 3. The lack of motivation among participants is a potentially invalidating aspect of the user study. \  \ We expanded the �lack of motivation� item in �Methods� -> �User study limitations� section in response to this concern. The change reflects that the limitation affected a small data portion and that we do not believe it invalidates the global result. \  \ 4. Coverage of the related work in visual analytics is spotty� should include Kang et al. and Bier et al. that perform similar in-depth sensemaking evaluation. Reference Wayne Gray's soft constraints work \  \ In the penultimate paragraph of �Related Work� -> �Guiding user�s choices� we introduce Gray�s soft constraints hypothesis and link it to nudging and persuasive technology. We also cite Kang and Bier�s work in �Related work in visual analytics�, second paragraph. \  \ 5. The provocative (and thus interesting) concepts of ""libertarian paternalism"" and ""nudge-based interaction"" are not discussed in much detail. \  \ Given the reviewers� interest we expanded the �Related Work� -> �Guiding user�s choices� section (last two paragraphs) with Gray�s soft constraints hypothesis, nudge opportunities seen by Sunstein, Thaler and Fogg, and a more ample discussion on ethical concerns. \  \ 6. The linkage between the interface changes and visual analytics is a little questionable \  \ We clarified the Thomas & Cook confusion (R3) in the third paragraph of the introduction by removing the �Illuminating the path� reference and adding more relevant ones. \  \ We believe we now better highlight our work�s connection to VA in the second paragraph of the �Related work in visual analytics� section. Specifically, we note that systems embraced by VA facilitate the management of analysis artifacts to support peoples� memory and attention and we see using interfaces to support limitations in deliberation as an extension of this work. \  \ 7. Data collection methods for the qualitative evaluation are not properly specified. It is possible that researchers read into the observational data patterns that they expected to see. \  \ We have included details on data collection in the opening paragraph of the �Results� -> �Qualitative analysis of subjects� workflows� section. \  \ 8. The findings are not particularly surprising and not fully discussed and generalized. The contribution would have been greater if the authors had distilled generally applicable guidelines. \  \ Following this comment we augmented the first paragraph of the �Dicussion� -> �Design guidelines� to clarify the goal of our study and mention a possible follow up study that could lead to more specific design guidelines. \  \ ------- \  \ 9. R2: More data on the complexity of the graphs used in the studies would be helpful \  \ We added a note on the size of the networks in the third paragraph of the �Methods� -> �Task description� section.  \  \ 10. R1: They state a number of interesting findings that are somewhat unrelated. I would have preferred to see more of a summary or evaluation of all of their findings. \  \ In response, in the �Results� -> �Qualitative analysis of subjects� workflows� section the third paragraph now summarizes the significance of the qualitative findings on biases and heuristics.  \  \ 11. R1: Gender neutral language should be used throughout; There are a handful of grammar and spelling errors throughout the text that should be fixed. \  \ We believe we have fixed these. \  \ 12. R1: I was unclear on the motivation for the particular version of normalization that was used in the paper. \  \ A motivation was included in the �Results� -> �Data preparation and analysis� section (third paragraph).  \  \  \ 13.Post-meeting comments:  (1) the potential confound of combining several nudges for the same experiment, thus not allowing the effects to be separated, (2) the not-so-subtle size of the nudges introduces, and (3) the lack of clear and generalizable findings that would be of value to the CHI community. \  \ First concern is now noted in the last paragraph of the �Results� -> �Quantitative support for nudging hypothesis� section. \  \ Second concern is briefly mentioned in the �Discussion� -> �Design guidelines� (first paragraph). \  \ For third concern please refer to revision item 8.  \  \ ---- \  \ The following concerns were not addressed in the revised manuscript: \   \ 14. R3: It is beyond the scope of the present study, but another interesting discussion could be had around the individual differences in performance. \  \ We do not feel we have enough data to discuss these aspects in an informed manner. \  \ 15. R1: Additionally, one of the ""nudges"" used fake user-bots to simulate some type of social translucence as to what other users were doing. This is an interesting idea, but I wonder about the ramifications of utilizing such fakes. The paper could have gone into more detail about this. \ R2: A key aspect in many analytical tasks is collaboration.  It seems like the ""presence"" portion of the UI, where users could see others working on their tasks, would be highly relevant to this case. Have the users thought about this aspect of the problem? \  \ This is an interesting discussion topic but we believe it is beyond the scope of the paper and would detract from the main message of the paper. \  \ 16. R2: The second nudge was designed to ""encourage users to compare and contrast hypotheses in parallel rather than perform a sequential search in hypothesis space.""  Can the authors explain why they chose a recency-based heuristic to highlight old hypotheses. \  \ The reviewer is right. Our particular highlighting brings little in terms of concrete functionality. As a highlighting mechanism, a relevance based one would be more useful. However, it is important to note that nudges should not be judged in terms of their added functionality (highlighting, filtering, annotation etc). They are rather simple embellishments of a system with a persuasive effect. We did not address this concern in the revised paper as we think it would detract from the main message of the paper. \  \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 22 17:54",""

However, patients are often under-informed about even basic aspects of their care. In this work, we hypothesize that mobile devices - which are increasingly available to patients - can be used as real-time information conduits to improve patient awareness and consequently improve patient care. To better understand the unique affordances that mobile devices offer in the hospital setting, we provided twenty-five patients with mobile phones that presented a dynamic, interactive report on their progress, care plan, and care team throughout their emergency department stay. Through interviews with these patients, their visitors, and hospital staff, we explore the benefits and challenges of using the mobile phone as an information display, finding overall that this is a promising approach to improving patient awareness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that only a small number of technology challenges remain before such a system could be deployed without researcher intervention.","1.

We employ an `augmented' storytelling methodology where we manipulate the modality of an `emotive' channel that accompanies the speech, and the contextual expectation of the listener. Comparing a remote upper-arm touch against a similarly timed flashing light, we explore the importance of the touch modality in affect conveyance.  Our second manipulation involves two cover stories where the listener is told that the touch or flashing light is triggered either by the storyteller expressively squeezing a touch input device while speaking, or by measured `high points' in the mental state of the storyteller. Our results show that the story accompanied by communicative touch resulted in a significant increase in the sense of connectedness with the storyteller over the speech-only condition, and a trend toward greater affective conveyance.

Added a small section on what this study suggests in the \       design of remote touch system and future work in the Discussion \       Session (page 9) \ ""As we found, the combination of \\textit{Speech + Communicative Touch} enhances the sense of connectedness significantly and also suggests  a trend of greater emotional experience.  More importantly, this is achieved when users experienced the communicative touch in an immediate ``non-symbolic"" way without pre-defined message coding-decoding process. We believe \\textit{Speech}, provided as a contextualizing channel for touch, plays a key role in retaining the capacity of touch in conveying sense of connectedness and affect in an immediate fashion.  Without a contextualizing channel, users will tend to use the device to send messages with some kind of `tactile Morse code' in order to `give meaning' to the touch interaction \\cite{ChaRK01}. This may severely compromise the immediacy of touch for affect conveyance.  \  \ Our research raises more open questions than it answers. In this study, the speech and touch channels are absolutely time synchronized. What if these two channels are temporally mismatched?  How much time displacement is noticeable to users? What is the relationship between the degree of mismatch and the users' experience of affect?  How may touch work with other channels, such as text messaging, a movie or a clip of music? These questions are worth further investigation. "" \  \  \ 2. Added more explanation on Figure 5 (page 6) \ ""Figure \\ref {Figure:InteractionPlot} shows the interaction plot of channels and expectations. The X-axis shows two manipulations of expectation (\\textit{Communicative} vs \\textit{Measure}), and the Y-axis shows the rating of sense of closeness toward the storyteller.

However, less is known about how groups, such as communities, use and appropriate these technologies, and the implications for community structures. In a study of 188 very active online enterprise communities, we found systematic differences in size, demographics and participation, aligned with differences in community types. Different types of communities differed in their appropriation of social software tools to create and use shared resources, and build relationships. We propose implications for design of community support features, services for potential community members, and organizations looking to derive value from online groups. ","1.

Our findings present a case where skilled users can approach a similar problem with diverging analysis strategies. In the group we observed, strategies fell within two broad categories: within-graph analysis, in which a user generates a few graph layouts and interacts heavily within them, and between-graph analysis, in which a user generates a series of graphs and switches between them in sequence. Differences in strategies lead to distinct interaction patterns, and are likely to be best supported by different interface designs. We characterize these observed strategies and discuss their implications for scientific visualization design and evaluation.","1. Tibco Spotﬁre S+. Accessed 9/21/2011. \ 2.

In contrast, public health research argues for an activist approach focused on how certain groups disproportionately experience disease and eliminating these disparities. Taking this activist stance, we examine how technology can reduce health inequalities by disrupting power relationships and helping communities pursue social change. We discuss our tool, Community Mosaic (CM), which allows individuals to share their healthy eating ideas with one another as a means of advocating behavior change. Our results characterize how CM helped facilitate activism (i.e., collective efforts to counter local challenges to healthy living) and shift users� attitudes regarding their role as advocates for health. We contribute to the field of HCI by using our findings to present a set of recommendations for future research focused on designing and evaluating health promotion tools using an activist lens.","1.

Provides recommendations for HCI research focused on health inequalities and the ecological influences on behaviors and attitudes.","Andrea G. Parker","agrimes@cc.gatech.edu","Thanks again to the reviewers and ACs for their helpful suggestions in improving this paper! \  \ 1) We explained why we made messages anonymous in the �Community Mosaic� section (to help users feel comfortable sharing). We also discussed how the downside of message anonymity is that viewers cannot assess message contributors� expertise (�Limitations� section).  \  \ 2) In the �Community Mosaic� section, we clarified that we based CM�s design on the recommendations that our participants made in the formative focus groups, and we make it clear that the two recommendations we note in the text are examples of some of our participants� desires (not all of them).   \  \ 3) In the �Post-CM Deployment� section, we clarified that focus groups were open-ended, guided by two broad topics (how useful (or not) CM is for helping to improve the community�s eating habits and how CM could be improved).  \  \ 4) In the Method section, we clarified the study phases by referring to data collection pre-, during, and post-deployment of the CM Display. We further clarified that p-deployment, participants filled out a survey and were asked to begin sending messages to CM to seed the system. We then explicitly state that the �Deployment� phase refers to when we installed the CM Display. We further discuss that during this deployment period, participants completed 1-2 phone interviews. While we did conduct observations of CM�s use, we did not include this information in our Method description to conserve space and since as we did not report on this (limited) data in our paper.  Finally, we discuss how post-deployment, the CM Display was removed and we conducted surveys and focus groups.  \  \ 5) We clarified that the goal of our research was to begin exploring the design space of health promotion tools focused on addressing activist concerns. For example, in the Introduction we state, �To begin exploring the design space of activist health promotion tools, we developed Community Mosaic (CM).� To further clarify our goals, in the beginning of the Community Mosaic section we state, �Focusing on activist concerns creates opportunities for new types of health promotion systems. To begin unpacking the implications of such an approach, we created Community Mosaic (CM).� \  \ 6) We ensured that in our Introduction and Related Work sections we clarified the contribution of our work, by clearly stating the limited research on issues of health inequity, power relationships, and other activist concerns within HCI research on health. We then state that our current work explores the implications of taking an activist approach to health technology design and evaluation (beginning of the �Community Mosaic� section). Finally we also ensured that the paper emphasizes the unique contribution of our work in that, �through our findings, we show how a community-anchored digital tool can facilitate health activism (i.e., collective efforts to counter local and cultural challenges to healthy living) and help shift users� attitudes regarding their role as advocates for health behavior change� (�Results� section). \  \ 7) At the beginning of the Results section we included CM usage data, including the # of messages shared (total=278; average=6, min=0, max=32) and display usage (messages were viewed 1585 times). We also added Table 1, which describes how often participants visited the display. In the �Potential for Impact� section we reflect upon the relationship between participants� lightweight interaction with CM and the attitudinal impact that we observed (e.g., their belief that they help to improve the health of the community by using CM). We discuss how our results suggest that even small amounts of feedback can help contributors see the impact they have on their community. At the same time, we suggest that one direction for future work would be to provide more detailed feedback to CM users regarding how the information they have shared is helping to transform the community�s behaviors.. \  \ 8) In the �Community Mosaic� section clarified that HCI experts evaluated CM to assess basic usability criteria and help us test the robustness of the system. We emphasize that this evaluation was to help us prepare CM for our field study, in which we were able to understand our target population�s views on quite a number of topics including its usefulness for improving the community�s health, twhat should be changed about the design, the impact of viewing messages on participants� own eating behaviors, etc. (also see Method and Results sections). We clearly state that in this paper, we focus our discussion on to what extent CM was a useful tool for supporting health advocacy.  \  \ 9) We discuss the implications of having to use the YMCA�s guidelines for filtering messages in a new paragraph added to the �Negotiating Values� section. \  \ 10) In the �Innovation� section we edited the text, removing the statement about participants �not mindlessly sharing messages�, which had a negative connotation. In its place we added text to more accurately explain our point: that many participants, �purposefully and selectively chose those experiences that might best expand viewers� understanding of how to eat healthfully�.  \  \ 11) At the end of the �Health Promotion in HCI� section we discuss how CM differs from EatWell, particularly that while EatWell leveraged audio, CM supported visual displays of information. Also, we note that CM provides content creators with viewer feedback on their messages.  \  \ 12) When recommending that HCI research focus on the broader context of health management (i.e., going beyond behavioral change), we reference Maitland 2011 (�Re-Thinking the Context of Health Management� section). \  \ 13) We clarified that we are encouraging a focus on collective action in the design of health applications specifically, and acknowledge that there is a growing amount of this work outside of the health domain. For space reasons, we did not cite Hendry & Woelfer�s work, but in looking at R2�s review, we noted that their main concern was that we point to other work on collective action, noting that there is a growing body of this work outside of health. As such, we note this point in the �Health Promotion Through Collective Action� section, and cite Maitland 2011 and some of our existing references that focused on collective action [14,18,27]. \  \ 14) We describe the theoretical motivation for our research in the 2nd paragraph of the �Community Mosaic� section, reference research on collectivism and they lay health advisor model.  \  \ 15) We removed much of the italics in the paper, edited our references, and fixed the Introduction to note that we provide 2 contributions. \  \ 16) We addressed the 2AC�s concerns as well, fixing our use of �affect� and �effect� (e.g., note the title change), and �such low-fat starches"" was changed to ""such as low-fat starches"" in the �Counteracting Local Barriers to Healthy Eating� section. \ ","","health","","FormatComplete","","Honorable Mention","Sep 23 19:26","1"

We used this multifactorial technique to create two new touchscreen phone keyboard layouts based on three design metrics: minimizing finger travel distance in order to maximize text entry speed, a new metric to maximize the quality of spell correction by reducing tap ambiguity, and maximizing familiarity through a similarity function with the standard Qwerty layout. The paper describes the optimization process and resulting layouts for a standard trapezoid shaped keyboard and a more rectangular layout. Fitts' law modelling shows a predicted 11% improvement in entry speed without taking into account the significantly improved error correction potential and the subsequent effect on speed. In initial user tests typing speed dropped from approx. 21 wpm with Qwerty to 13 wpm (64%) on first use of our layout but recovered to 18 wpm (85%) within four short trial sessions, and was still improving. NASA TLX forms showed no significant difference on load between Qwerty and our new layout use in the fourth session. Together we believe this shows the new layouts are faster and can be quickly adopted by users.","1. Allen, J. M., McFarlin, L. A. and Green, T.

To further understand these implications we present fieldwork observations of work practice in neurosurgery theatres.

Systems like these enable the estimation of movements of various body parts from raw inertial motion or depth sensor data. However, the interface developer is still left with the challenging task of creating a system that recognizes these movements as embodying meaning. The machine learning approach for tackling this problem requires the collection of data sets that contain the relevant body movements and their associated semantic labels. These data sets directly impact the accuracy and performance of the gesture recognition system and should ideally contain all natural variations of the movements associated with a gesture. This paper addresses the problem of collecting such gesture datasets. In particular, we investigate the question of what is the  most appropriate semiotic modality of instructions for conveying to human subjects the movements the system developer needs them to perform. The results of our qualitative and quantitative analysis indicate that the choice of modality has a significant impact on the performance of the learnt gesture recognition system; particularly in terms of correctness and coverage.","1.

The choice of instructions is also discusses from a semiotic perspective.   \ Figure 4 has been removed and Figure 3 more clearly annotated and explained in the methods section.   \ The introduction includes an explanation of the inadequacies of automated systems that are rule based rather than trained on examples of associations between kinematics and semantics.  The later part of the introduction has also been expanded as described in the rebuttal to address the importance of instructions and the role of the designer. \ The rewritten results and discussion sections explain the merits of both Image+Text and Video+Text in terms of the f-scores, questionnaire data and interviews.  We have added a third results section that uses questionnaire data not previously included to help choose the best modality combination.

ERN is triggered when a user either makes a mistake or the application behaves differently from their expectation. We first show that ERN can be seen on signals captured by EEG headsets like Emotiv� when doing a typical multiple choice reaction time (RT) task � Flanker task. We then present a single-trial online ERN algorithm that works by pre-computing the coefficient matrix of a logistic regression classifier using some data from a multiple choice reaction time task and uses it to classify incoming signals of that task on a single trial of data. We apply it to an interactive selection task that involved users selecting an object under time pressure. Furthermore the study was conducted in a typical office environment with ambient noise. Our results show that online single trial ERN detection is possible using off-the-shelf headsets during tasks that are typical of interactive applications. We then design a Superflick experiment with an integrated module mimicking an ERN detector to evaluate the accuracy of detecting ERN in the context of assisting users in interactive tasks. Based on these results we discuss and present several HCI scenarios for use of ERN.","1. Campbell, A., T. Choudhury, S. Hu, H. Lu, M.K. Mukerjee, M. Rabbi, and R.D.S. Raizada.

Braille maps allow their users to understand the spatial relationship between a set of places. However, physical Braille maps are often costly, may not always cover an area of interest with sufficient detail, and might not present up-to-date information. We built a handheld system for representing geographical information called SpaceSense, which includes custom spatial tactile feedback hardware�multiple vibration motors attached to different locations on a mobile touch-screen device. It offers high-level information about the distance and direction towards a destination and bookmarked places through vibrotactile feedback to help the user maintain the spatial relationships between these points. SpaceSense also adapts a summarization technique for online user reviews of public and commercial venues. Our user study shows that participants could build and maintain the spatial relationships between places on a map more accurately with SpaceSense compared to a system without spatial tactile feedback. They pointed specifically to having spatial tactile feedback as the contributing factor in successfully building and maintaining their mental map.","1. Amemiya, T., Sugiyama, H.

To access and switch between different functions, valuable screen real estate must be allocated to buttons and menus, or users must perform special actions, such as touch-and-hold, double tap, or multi-finger chords. Even still, this only adds a few bits of additional information, leaving touch interaction unwieldy for many tasks. In this work, we suggest using a largely unutilized touch input dimension: shear (force tangential to a screen's surface). Similar to pressure, shear can be used in concert with conventional finger positional input. However, unlike pressure, shear provides a rich, analog 2D input space, which has many powerful uses. We put forward five classes of advanced interaction that considerably expands the envelope of interaction possible on touchscreens.","1.

We introduce the construct of service mediation, which includes the technical, social, and knowledge labor practices involved in enabling access to and use of an e-government service. We explore the service mediation activities of outreach, technological assistance, providing knowledge, and ongoing engagement. These activities bring to light how successful service relationships involve fostering a process, bridging relationships, and providing broader scaffolding. The results of our research highlight the role service mediation plays in the use of services and service technologies in information-rich organizations. This research extends previous conceptualizations of mediation by documenting how mediators support broader service processes for their clients, transform potential beneficiaries into clients, and engage in long term assistance. Therefore, this work moves beyond prior conceptualizations of mediation that concentrate solely on enabling access and use of specific technologies. ","1. Bucy, E. Social access to the internet.

Can help researchers understand how to enable access and use of services for low-resource populations.","Lynn Dombrowski","ldombrow@uci.edu","We have incorporated the following changes into our paper:  \ 1. Define service in the context of this research \ 2. Articulate the attributes of service mediators explored in these data \ 3. Specify the generalizability and limitations of this research \ 4. Present a broader slate of implications for design \ 5. Describe a research agenda based on the concept of service mediation \  \ For items1, 2:  \ Based on our feedback, throughout the paper we have tighten and hone the definitions of service mediation and service mediators throughout the paper, including better positioning where our paper sits in relation to prior work regarding service mediations. We recognize that the types of individuals with whom we conducted research were a specific type of service mediator and that there could be other types of service mediators.  \  \ In the abstract, introduction, and conclusion, we have more clearly positioned the research contribution of this work.  \  \ For example, we added the following text in our introduction: �Previous research studying service systems has focused on clients (e.g., [18, 32]) and employees (e.g., [4, 9, 25]) of service providers.  In our research, service mediation also involves individuals who assist clients outside of the service provider�s formal organization and processes. Prior research on mediation has called for additional research that studies the �human side of service delivery� [23]. We extend the existing literature on mediation by addressing this need, examining the mediation activities that support service processes and the long-term relationships between mediators and clients that, in turn, support the ongoing, human-centered nature of service mediation.� \  \ Additionally, this text was also added to introduction:  \ �Previous research studying service systems has focused on clients (e.g., [18, 32]) and employees (e.g., [4, 9, 25]) of service providers.  In our research, service mediation also involves individuals who assist clients outside of the service provider�s formal organization and processes. Prior research on mediation has called for additional research that studies the �human side of service delivery� [23]. We extend the existing literature on mediation by addressing this need, examining the mediation activities that support service processes and the long-term relationships between mediators and clients that, in turn, support the ongoing, human-centered nature of service mediation.� \  \ In the service Mediation section, we added:  \ �In such encounters, mediator�s specialized knowledge and understanding of bureaucratic complexity assists in navigating options, rules, and regulations. Our research extends existing conceptualizations of mediation by demonstrating how mediators do more than walk clients through the use of a technology. In actuality, they support the entire service process by actively generating potential clients, engaging in long-term assistance, and providing �third party� knowledge as expert outsiders.� \  \ In the conclusion, we added: \ �Our construct of service mediation extends existing concepts of mediation work, providing a more holistic understanding of the different kinds of labors involved. Our research contributes a detailed and empirically grounded description of the work practices that enable mediators to support entire service processes for their clients, including the �creation� of clients and their support throughout an ongoing engagement with a service.� \  \ Items 3, 4, and 5: \ We recrafted the conclusions section to incorporate design recommendations and a research agenda for service mediators. Our new conclusion includes concrete implications for design, aimed at strengthening and amplifying a service mediator's capacity to assist clients. The research agenda frames a larger agenda based on the concept of service mediation.","","","ContentComplete","FormatComplete","","None","Sep 23 19:42",""

However, cursor interactions are not all the same; different types of cursor behavior patterns exist, such as reading, hesitating, scrolling and clicking, each of which has a different meaning. We conduct a search study with 36 subjects and 32 search tasks to determine when gaze and cursor are aligned, and thus when the cursor position is a good proxy for gaze position. We study the effect of time, behavior patterns, user, and search task on the gaze-cursor alignment, findings which lead us to question the maxim that ""gaze is well approximated by cursor."" These lessons inform an experiment in which we predict the gaze position with better accuracy than simply using the cursor position, improving the state-of-the-art technique for approximating visual attention with the cursor. Our new technique can help make better use of large-scale cursor data in identifying how users examine Web search pages.","1. Arroyo, E., Selker, T., and Wei, W.

However, reducing electricity use can be difficult with only a meter and a monthly or annual electricity bill. With the emergence of new power meters units, information on electricity consumption is now available digitally and wirelessly. This enables the design and deployment of a new class of persuasive systems giving consumers insight into their use of energy resources and means for reducing it. In this paper, we explore the design and use of one such system, Power Advisor, promoting electricity conservation through tailored information on a mobile phone or tablet. The use of the system in 10 households was studied over 7 weeks.

Advertisers believe targeted and personalized ads to be more effective, but many users are concerned about their privacy.  We conducted a study where 30 participants completed a simulated holiday booking task; each page showing ads with different degrees of personalization.  Participants fixated twice as long when ads contained their photo.  Participants reported being more likely to notice ads with their photo, holiday destination, and name, but also increasing levels of discomfort with increasing personalization.  We conclude that greater personalization in ad content may achieve higher levels of attention, but that the most personalized ads are also the least acceptable.  The noticeability benefit in using someone's photo to make them look at an ad may be offset by the privacy cost.  As more personal data becomes available to advertisers, it becomes important that these trade-offs are considered.","1. 2011 Consumer Research Results: Privacy and Online Behavioral Advertising, TRUSTe, 2011. \ 2.

The summary of these changes is: \  \ Statistical analysis to confirm validity of the results as presented in the rebuttal were included. These were : \ For all artifact cases the two tailed t-test was run for the stimuli time period against the same ground truth time period. In all cases the null hypothesis was rejected and the p-values were popping p=4.5e-09, popping on person p=1.102e-36, ghosting p=5.89e-05, blurring p=0.0031 and blurring on Person p=3.14e-13. Given the rejection of the null hypothesis in all cases and the fact that the probabilities are all less than 0.05 there is sufficient evidence for the statistical significance of the results. We also ran the two-tailed t-test between popping and popping on person and blurring against blurring on person. Both of these tests also rejected the null hypothesis with  p-values of p=6.3e-12 and p=5.03e-05. Given these values we can safely assume a statistically significant difference between the responses over all artifacts. We also a two-tailed t-test of one randomly selected participant against the averaged results of all the other participants. For all stimuli the null hypothesis was accepted and the  p-values were popping p =0.14, popping on person p=0.854,blurring=0.85,blurring on person=0.97 and ghosting p=0.74. Given these  p-values and the acceptance of the null hypothesis it is clear that any one participant's response is close to the average. There are no statistically significant differences.  \  \ Clarification of what the plots represent. That is all the plots (Figure 2 and 3) are averaged over all participants over all trials for a given stimulus. \  \ All typo's as mentioned by the reviewers. \  \ Clarification of treatment of eye movements and artifacts. The text included is: \  \ Eye movements were considered and dealt with in the analysis of the results. We manually removed all trials with blinks and severe eye movements.  We used a 4-electrode EOG as a reference point to remove all data with accidental eye movements. We also manually rejected data with a lot of alpha waves.  \  As regards to eye movements from watching the video, they were the same for all trials and all artifacts over all participants. All videos were exactly the same including the reference video (ground truth) and induced identical eye movements. Given the identical nature of the stimulus it is valid to compare the results.  \ Re-evaluation of  latency of popping on person artifact. For this artifact we re evaluated the data sets with the correct time frames and have included the accurate plot (Figure 2) with the accurate latency and analysis. \  \ We have also included and highlighted the motivation and need for an implicit measure as opposed to the subjective judgment of users.","","","ContentComplete","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 03:21",""

They are often put into practice e.g. to reduce the number of vibrators to be worn on the body and thereby build a less cumbersome feedback device.  Recently, these techniques have been found to be applicable to eliciting ""out of the body"" experiences as well (e.g. through user-held external objects).  This paper examines the possibility of applying this phenomenon to interacting with virtual objects.  Two usability experiments were run to test the effects of funneling and saltation respectively for perceiving tactile sensation from a virtual object in an augmented reality setting.  Experimental results have shown solid evidences for phantom sensations from virtual objects with funneling, but mixed results for saltation.","1. Alles, D.S.

We did our best to accommodate most of the comments.  The following responses are organized according to our itemized rebuttal. \  \  \ 1.	Use cases \  \ Reviewers wanted to see more use cases, e.g. what type of interaction can newly be realized as a result of the experiments (also related to motivation of this work).   \  \ --> We beefed up the motivation for our work in the introduction and also added additional figures and explanations as how it can be applied to building actual interfaces. \  \ 2.	Wearing ear muffs \  \ --> We added a sentence explaining and stressing that the ear muff was tested such that no sound could be heard during the experiment, and did not affect the outcome of the experiment. \  \ 3.	Too many figures and tables / Details about experimental procedure \  \ --> We went over the paper again and eliminated several less important figures and tables.  We also redrew and modified existing figures to make them more self-explanatory and simpler to understand: \  \ (1) Figure 2 redrawn \ (2) Original Figure 4 eliminated \ (3) p-value tables eliminated from original Figures 5, 6, 7 \ (4) Figure 8�s table and figure separated \ (5) Table 4 and 5 rearranged \ (6) Figures 12, 13, 14 and 16 eliminated \ (7) Last use case figure updated   \  \ Also added responses to specific questions about experimental details: \ (1) regarding the pools of subjects in Experiments I and II. \ (2) how the holding distance was maintained. \ (3) on more details of the vibrator hardware (also illustrated in Figure 2). \  \ 4.	Dedicated section on (out of body) phantom sensations \  \ --> It turned out to be difficult to explain the phantom sensation effects in words.  Thus we used existing and modified figures to provide intuitive explanations. \  \ 5.	Qualitative description of the phantom sensations \  \  We added a paragraph describing the user surveyed qualitative descriptions of the phantom sensations in the Results section. \  \ 6.	More intuitive explanation of the results \  \ We revised the manuscript to be more intuitive and compact in summarizing the experimental results. \  \ As for specific questions: \ (1) We have removed the statement relating our results to synaesthesia for lack of sufficient evidence (as for now). \ (2) We revised the sentence where one reviewer had a difficulty in understanding (""... saltation only showed relatively less room for reasonably detailed control ..."").  We meant to say that the results indicated relatively higher precision/resolution with funneling in creating phantom sensations on the virtual ruler. \ (3) We also expanded on the possible topics for future work and especially for the effects of combining with more elaborate visual feedback. \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 06:45",""

However, the appropriateness of this approach is under increasing criticism, with statisticians, economists, and psychologists arguing against the use of routine interpretation of results using ""canned"" p values. Three problems with current practice - the fallacy of the transposed conditional, a neglect of power, and the reluctance to interpret the size of effects - can lead us to build weak theories based on vaguely specified hypothesis, resulting in empirical studies which produce results that are of limited practical or scientific use. Using publicly available data presented at CHI 2010 [19] as an example we address each of the three concerns and promote consideration of the magnitude and actual importance of effects, as opposed to statistical significance, as the new criteria for evaluating CHI research.","1.

At the same time, practitioners see a need to strengthen reliability in evaluation.

We conducted an online survey to explore the user experience (UX) of early stage mobile AR applications available in the market in spring 2011, covering both location-based AR browsers and image recognition AR applications for object-based interaction. We identify various types of experiences such applications have evoked by qualitatively analyzing 84 users’ narratives of their most satisfying and unsatisfying experiences. The results highlight, for example, experiences of awareness of surroundings, empowerment, positive surprise, amazement and fascination from the novelty value, as well as some examples of immersion and social connectivity. The analysis indicates that the applications have not yet reached their potential in evoking a multifaceted user experience that is characteristic especially to AR. This work helps in understanding the experiential design potential in mobile AR and points out UX issues to further focus on in design. ","1. Azuma, R.T. Tracking requirements for augmented reality.

The methodological discussion addresses the issue of how experiences that were taking place 3 months ago are helpful to study the UX. \ - Finally, minor edits with regard to language and clarity have been done throughout the paper (e.g. the terms used in referring to specific types of experiences in the prior work) \  \ PS.

In this paper we explore how Ubicomp and HCI studies have approached the notion of privacy, often as a quantifiable concept. Leaning on several theoretical frameworks, but in particular Nissenbaum's notion of contextual integrity, we question the viability of obtaining universal answers in terms of people's ""general"" privacy practices and apply elements of Nissenbaum's theory to our own data in order to illustrate its relevance. We then suggest restructuring inquiries into information sharing in studies of state-of-the-art technologies and analyze contextually grounded issues using a different, more specific vocabulary. Finally, we provide the first building blocks to such vocabulary.","1. Agre, P. Introduction. In Agre, P. and Rotenberg, M. Technology and privacy: the new landscape. MIT Press. 1998. \ 2.

In this paper we present Phylo-Genie, a tabletop interface for fostering collaborative learning of phylogenetics.  We conducted an experimental study with 56 participants, comparing students' conceptual learning and engagement using Phylo-Genie as: 1) a multi-touch tabletop interface and 2) a pen and paper activity. Our findings show that the tabletop implementation fosters collaborative learning by engaging users in the activity.

Therefore we removed an inappropriate example and reordered our arguments to increase the clarity. \ In addition, reviewers commented that some section need to add more information related with the prototypes and related works. We insert the requirements to work with dongles of the prototypes in first part of explanation of Clipoid, responding to R1's comment. R1 also commented that there is a commercial example related with Clipoid system, which is Nokia 360 and Luna headset. We checked the commercial product and added them as related works. Also, R1 commented to add how the metaphor of prototype affects to the user. We added a new subsection in Analysis and Results is to explain it. R5 commented that there should be more implementation details for the Clipoid prototype. We improved the implementation part with more detailed description. \ Lastly, there are some comments related with the figures in the paper. R2 commented that the Figure 1's light blue background reduces the clarity of the text. So we changed the picture to black and white version. R2 and R3 commented that the Figure 4 shows the same device with Figure 2 & 3 and there is no picture taken from the user-study.

These mobile Q&A services are very different from traditional Q&A sites in that questions/answers are short in length and are exchanged via mobile devices (e.g., SMS or mobile Internet). While traditional Q&A sites have been well investigated, so far little is known about the mobile Q&A usage. To understand mobile Q&A usage, we analyzed 2.4 million question/answer pairs spanning a 14 month period from Naver Mobile Q&A and performed a complementary survey study of 555 active mobile Q&A users. We find that mobile Q&A is deeply wired into users' everyday life activities--its usage is largely dependent on users' spatial, temporal, and social contexts; the key factors of mobile Q&A usage are accessibility/convenience of mobile Q&A, promptness of receiving answers, and users' satisficing behavior of information seeking (i.e., minimizing efforts and settling with good enough information). We also observe that users tend to seek more factual information attributed to everyday life activities than they do on traditional Q&A sites and that they exhibit unique interaction patterns such as repeating and refining questions as coping strategies in seeking information needs. Our main findings reported in the paper have significant implications on the design of mobile Q&A systems.","1. Comparison of Hourly Wireless Internet Usage. http://mobizen.pe.kr/971. \ 2.

While we had been analyzing the data set, we also found that sometimes the askers mentioned the answerer�s name in the follow-up questions (although happening quite rarely ~ 0.1%). For instance, one user asked the following: ""asgsky13: I would really appreciate it if you recommend more songs!"" Another interesting case happens when the asker has frustrated with the answer quality (absurd answers, insulting remarks, including RTFM style answers). For instance, ""whduddn: please do not post weird answers!""  \  \ (2) (Nonresponse error): The reviewer commented that due to low response rate of the email survey, the survey respondents may not be representative enough. To understand the potential impact of nonresponse error, we sent out the first part of questionnaire in Nov. 2011 and collected responses from 332 users in the second survey. We performed statistically tests (via chi square goodness of fit tests) and found that in each usage level group, the two survey results are almost statistically identical.    \  \ (3) (Factual questions): The reviewer asked whether the higher rate of factual questions may be related to homework. The topic category of Education contains all the homework related questions, although we did not explicitly report this in the paper. That�s why in Table 2 (titled, ""breakdown of questions based on types, topics, and personalness""), unlike the other topic categories, the fraction of information questions is very high, namely 72.3% (second to the Sports whose rate is 94.3%).  When examining our survey participants� questions (who are junior-high or high students), we find that they also asked a number of health related questions.  It appears that those young people may feel more comfortable asking such questions over Q&A.      \  \ (4) (Cultural differences): The reviewer commented that the comparisons to previous data sets may not be appropriate because they may be dependent on cultural differences. We also agree that such a bias may exist, and we are currently planning to perform similar content analysis of other Korean-based services including Naver Q&A and social networking based Q&A. Interestingly, Yang et al. [1] recently showed that there are differences across cultures, yet their usage behavior (in terms of fraction of opinion, recommendation, factual) are quite consistent; thus, we can say that social Q&A's usage is still very different from that of mobile Q&A.  \  \ [1] Yang, J., Morris, M.

This paper uses interactional analysis of video data from fifteen naturalistically recorded journeys with GPS to understand the navigational practices deployed by drivers and passengers. The paper documents five types of 'trouble' where GPS systems cause issues and confusion for drivers around: destinations, routes, maps & sensors, timing and relevance and legality. The paper argues that to design GPS systems better we need to move beyond the notion of a docile driver who follows GPS command blindly, to a better understanding of how drivers, passengers and GPS systems work together. We develop this in discussing how technology might better support 'instructed action'. \ ","1. Aporta, C., Higgs, E., et al.

However, it is not known how people understand heart rate feedback, or what issues need to be taken into account when designing technologies including heart rate feedback. To explore this, we created a heart rate communication probe that was used in two qualitative in-lab studies and a two-week field trial in participants' homes. Results show that heart rate feedback is a strong connectedness cue that affects the interaction in various ways, depending on a number of interrelated factors. In particular, we found two distinct categories of effects: heart rate as information and  heart rate as connection. We propose two mechanisms that could explain these observations and draw out the implications they have for future use of heartbeat communication to support social connectedness or other aspects of social interaction.","1.

This is followed by a description of how these design principles are mapped to a novel interface for interactive data retrieval. The interface was realized into a working system and evaluated against a traditional web interface for both high literacy (HL) and LL users. The suitability of the designs was analyzed using performance data, subjective feedback and an observational analysis. The findings from the study suggest that LL users perform better and prefer the proposed designs over a traditional web interface.","1. Ahlberg, C. and Shneidennan, B.

Analyses of such networks are often long and complex, and may require several sessions by multiple users. Therefore, it is often difficult for users to recall their own exploration history or share it with others. We introduce GraphTrail, an interactive visualization for analyzing networks through exploration of node and edge aggregates that captures users' interactions and integrates this history directly in the exploration workspace. To facilitate large network analysis, GraphTrail integrates aggregation with familiar charts, drag-and-drop interaction on a canvas, and a novel pivoting mechanism for transitioning between aggregates. Through a three-month field study with a team of archeologists and a qualitative lab study with ten users, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the benefits of integrated exploration history, including analysis comprehension, insight discovery, and exploration recall.","1.

This improves exploration recall and sharing of analyses with others. ","Cody Dunne","cdunne@cs.umd.edu","* In response to 1AC�s Post PC Meeting requests: \  \ 1. Tone down the contribution in analytic provenance and emphasize the visual analytics. \ We made substantial efforts throughout the paper to emphasize our primary contribution as a visual analytics system for exploring large multivariate, heterogeneous networks, with a secondary contribution of capturing and showing a user�s exploration history. Specifically, we: \  \ a) Changed order of the title, renaming the system GraphTrail, and using �exploration history� throughout instead of �analytic provenance�. \  \ b) Changed order and text of the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of the introduction,  \  \ c) Changed order and integration of the related work,  \  \ d) Changed order and text of the first two paragraphs of the NetCharts (now GraphTrail) section, \  \ e) Changed some of the text of the conclusion. \  \ 2. Reword or defend the description of insight based evaluation. \ We had tried to avoid any comparisons with insight-based evaluation in the first submission, but did not go far enough in differentiating our approach. We have changed the term we use to �findings� as our methodology did not follow the exact structure described for insight-based evaluations. We provide a simple definition of findings in the second paragraph of the lab study section and several examples in the second paragraph, the following two paragraphs, and the Scenario subsection. \  \ 3. Complete the rebuttal changes \  \ a) Clarify dual contribution  \ See 1., above. \  \ b) Clearly contrast against prior systems, motivate showing exploration histories, and link the related work sections. \ We rewrote the paragraphs in the related work dealing with exploration histories. As we now focus on visual analytics instead of analytic provenance, we trimmed less relevant work (Ma, Vis �95) and added citations to more closely related papers (Jankun-Kelly et al, TVCG 2007; Bavoil et al, VIS �05).  We included several user studies of exploration histories that demonstrate the value of showing them to users (Kang and Stasko, VAST �11; Lipford et al, VAST �10; Ware et al, Diagrams �08). We also include a better discussion of exploration histories and their benefit as the 3rd paragraph of the introduction. \  \ c) Scalability \ We revised and added to the Scalability subsection�s second paragraph, talking more about user strategies, layout management cost, and several strategies for reducing this burden used by other tools and their drawbacks. \  \ d) Clarify what we mean by insight, how target insights were collected, and that we ensured the study phases used separate parts of the data. \ See 2., above. We noted in that the pre-created explorations came from a different part of the dataset (Lab Study sec, par 2), and tried to clarify our process for finding published insights (par 4). \  \ e) Clarify goal and history of hybrid bar charts \ We clarified that we designed the hybrid bar chart to gain an overview of aggregate node counts and the aggregate edge counts connecting them, rather than looking at individual edges. We added a citation suggested by R3 to Pretorius and van Wijk, TVCG �06. (GraphTrail sec, par 1) \  \ * In response to the reviewers comments not addressed above: \  \ Meta \ In response to the reviewers� accolades about the field study, we changed the order of the two studies to give it precedence. \  \ R1 \  \ a) Clarified the two sort orders of tags in the tag cloud (Scenario sec, par 1-2; GraphTrail Design, par 3). \  \ b) Clarified that the paper topic attribute is manually annotated (GraphTrail sec., par 2). \  \ R2 \  \ a) We studied the provided references in great detail, deciding to include several in the related work. We do not cite ImageGraphs because we already include Jankun-Kelly et al, TVCG 2007, which uses ImageGraphs as an example and is much more relevant due to its history model. We can expound on why we included specific references and omitted others if necessary. \  \ R3 \  \ a) We do not include a copy and paste functionality, though it would be useful. Also, we do not include or an exploration history overview aside from scaling, but our revised Scalability section includes several ways to show these overviews more efficiently. \  \ b) We decided not to change Figs. 4 and 5 as the gaps are important for spatial memory. \  \ c) The Palantir reference suggested is not highly related. \  \ d) We added a line describing the motivation for and limitation of textual queries. (GraphTrail Design, 2nd to last par) \  \ R4  \  \ a) Clarify assumptions & statements \ We added citations in the Introduction and Related Work to back up our statements about the value of exploration histories. We also added a paragraph on the Exploration History Model that describes that we record and show a subset of meaningful actions necessary to understand the displayed analysis, rather than a complete model of analytic provenance. \  \ b) Additional references \ We added a citation to Stasko et al, VAST �07 (Related Work, 2nd to last par). However, we did not find the remaining suggested references to be particularly relevant. \  \ Additional Changes \  \ a) We removed the citation to Medlock et al (2005) as it was less relevant to the user study. \  \ b) We trimmed and edited throughout for space to include the reviewers� suggestions. \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 19:49",""

In this paper we study the prospects of an automatic video remixing and present the results of a study on users' perceptions and attitudes towards collaborative automatic mobile video production. The three findings are as follows: People assess automatic video remix memorabilia as fairly equal to amateur-made manual ones, even if the manually-created video remixes are better in overall quality; as a remixing actor, a computer can be perceived to be more trustworthy than a human remixer; and, the quality of the video remix and the publication forum of the remix outcome plays a significant role when people are deciding whether or not they need public acknowledgement for their contribution. We conclude by discussing the design implications for collaborative automatic mobile video production.","1. Chalfen R., Snapshot versions of life.

Specifically, accelerometers and gyroscopes worn on the arm (e.g., in a wristwatch) can sense arm gestures, enabling natural input in untethered scenarios. Two core components of any gesture recognition system are detecting when a gesture is occurring and  classifying which gesture a person has performed. In previous work, accurate detection has required significant computation, and high-accuracy classification has come at the cost of training the system on a per-user basis. In this note, we present a gesture detection method whose computational complexity does not depend on the duration of the gesture, and describe a novel method for recognizing gestures with only a single example from a new user.","1.

Our review of energy-related HCI research identifies a central cluster of work focused on electricity consumption feedback (ECF). Our review of literature outside of HCI highlights a number of emerging energy systems trends of strong relevance to HCI and interaction design, including smart grid, demand response, and distributed generation technologies. We conclude by outlining a range of opportunities for HCI to engage with the experiential, behavioral, social, and cultural aspects of these emerging systems, including highlighting new areas for ECF research that move beyond our field�s current focus on energy feedback displays to increase awareness and motivate individual conservation behavior.","1.

In an 18-participant laboratory study, we explore whether the keywords and captions with which users tag their photos can be used to help users more intuitively create and maintain access-control policies. We find that (a) tags created for organizational purposes can be repurposed to create efficient and reasonably accurate access-control rules; (b) users tagging with access control in mind develop coherent strategies that lead to significantly more accurate rules than those associated with organizational tags alone; and (c) participants can understand and actively engage with the concept of tag-based access control.","1.

To make sure that a game provides a satisfying experience, a meaningful analysis of gameplay data is crucial, particularly because the quality of a game directly relates to the experience a user gains from playing it. Automatic instrumentation techniques are increasingly used to record data during playtests. However, the evaluation of the data requires strong analytical skills and experience. The visualization of such gameplay data is essentially an information visualization problem, where a large number of variables have to be displayed in a comprehensible way in order to be able to make global judgments. This paper presents a visualization tool to assist the analytical process. It visualizes the game space as a set of nodes which players visit over the course of a game and is also suitable to observe time-dependent information, such as player distribution.  Our tool is not tailored to a specific type of genre. To show the flexibility of our approach we use two different kinds of games as case studies.","1. Algorithmics Group.

Several scholarly communities are addressing how to detect and manage such content: research in computer vision focuses on detection of inappropriate images, natural language processing technology has advanced to recognize insults. However, profanity detection systems remain flawed. Current list-based profanity detection systems have two limitations. First, they are easy to circumvent and easily become stale–that is, they cannot adapt to misspellings, abbreviations, and the fast pace of profane slang evolution. Secondly, they offer a one-size fits all solution; they typically do not accommodate domain, community and context specific needs. However, social settings have their own normative behaviors–what is deemed acceptable in one community may not be in another. In this paper, through analysis of comments from a social news site, we provide evidence that current systems are performing poorly and evaluate the cases on which they fail. We then address community differences regarding creation/tolerance of profanity and suggest a shift to more contextually nuanced profanity detection systems.","1. Boyd, D. and Marwick, A.

To address this shortcoming we conducted an experiment to investigate how ambient temperature and humidity could affect the usability of thermal feedback. If environmental conditions affect perception significantly, then it may not be suitable for mobile interactions. Evaluations were conducted outdoors in varying environmental conditions over a period of 5 months. Results showed that the ambient temperature has a significant impact on people's ability to detect stimuli and also their perception of these stimuli. Humidity has a negligible effect for most humidity values. Despite this, previous thermal feedback design recommendations still hold in varying temperatures and humidities showing that thermal feedback is a useful tool for mobile interaction.","1.

Aural interfaces support more eyes-free experiences, as users can primarily listen to the content and occasionally look at the device. Yet, designing aural information architectures remains a challenge. Specifically, back navigation is inefficient in the aural setting, as it forces users to listen to each previous page to retrieve the desired content. This paper introduces topic- and list-based back: two navigation strategies to enhance aural browsing. Both are manifest in Green-Savers Mobile (GSM), an aural mobile site. A study (N=29) compared both solutions to traditional back mechanisms. Our findings indicate that topic- and list-based back enable faster access to previous pages, improve the navigation experience and reduce perceived cognitive load. The proposed designs apply to a wide range of content-intensive, ubiquitous web systems.","1. Asakawa, C., and Itoh, T. User Interface of a Home Page Reader. Proc. ASSETS (1998), 149-156. \ 2.

This paper investigates suitable real-world mappings of foot gestures to invoke commands and interact with virtual workspaces. Our first study identified user preferences for mapping common mobile-device commands to gestures. We distinguish these gestures in terms of discrete and continuous command input. While discrete foot-based input has relatively few parameters to control, continuous input requires careful design considerations on how the user's input can be mapped to a control parameter (e.g. the volume knob of the media player). We investigate this issue further through three user-studies. Our results show that rate-based techniques are significantly faster, more accurate and result if far fewer target crossings compared to displacement-based interaction. We discuss these findings and identify design recommendations. ","1. Aliakseyeu, D., Irani, P., Lucero, A., Subramanian, S.

For users with visual impairment, or when occupied with another task that requires a user's visual attention, these phones can be difficult to use. Recently, marks initiating from the bezel, the physical touch-insensitive frame surrounding a touchscreen display, have been proposed as a method for eyes-free interaction. Due to the physical form factor of the mobile device, it is possible to access different parts of the bezel eyes-free. In this paper, we first studied the performance of different bezel menu layouts. Based on the results, we designed a bezel-based text entry application to gain insights into how bezel menus perform in a real-world application. From a longitudinal study, we found that the participants achieved 9.2 words per minute in situations requiring minimal visual attention to the screen. After only one hour of practice, the participants transitioned from novice to expert users. This shows that bezel menus can be adopted for realistic applications.","1. Accot, J. and Zhai, S.

Our research investigates users' SNS boundary regulation behavior. This paper presents results from a qualitative interview-based study to identify ""coping mechanisms"" that users devise outside explicit boundary-regulation interface features in order to manage interpersonal boundaries.

The work of volunteer coordinators is bridge-building work-bringing together numerous public constituencies as well as constituencies within their organizations. One might expect this class of work to be well supported by social software, some of which has been found to enable bridging social capital. However, we find that, in many ways, this class of technology fails to adequately support volunteer coordinators' bridge-building work. We discuss a number of strategies for bridge-building via social computing technologies, numerous challenges faced by volunteer coordinators in their use of these technologies, and opportunities for designing social software to better support bridge-building between organizations and the public.","1.

DiamondTouch does so reliably, but requires users to stay in assigned seats and cannot recognize users across sessions. We propose a different approach based on distinguishing users� shoes. While users are interacting with the table, our system Bootstrapper observes their shoes using one or more depth cameras mounted to the edge of the table. It then identifies users by matching camera images with a database of known shoe images. When multiple users interact, Bootstrapper associates touches with shoes based on hand orientation. The approach can be implemented using consumer depth cameras because (1) shoes offer large distinct features such as color, (2) shoes naturally align themselves with the ground, giving the system a well-defined perspective and thus reduced ambiguity. We report two simple studies in which Bootstrapper recognized participants from a database of 18 users with 95.8% accuracy. ","1.

To explore this potential, we introduce and evaluate two novel personalized keyboard interfaces, both of which adapt their underlying key-press classification models. The first keyboard also visually adapts the location of keys while the second one always maintains a visually stable rectangular layout. A three-session user evaluation showed that the keyboard with the stable rectangular layout significantly improved typing speed compared to a control condition with no personalization. Although no similar benefit was found for the keyboard that also offered visual adaptation, overall subjective response to both new touchscreen keyboards was positive. As personalized keyboards are still an emerging area of research, we also outline a design space that includes dimensions of adaptation and key-press classification features. ","1.

To support this input, widely adopted commercial touch-screen interfaces require mode switches to alternate keyboard layouts for most punctuation and symbols. Our approach is to augment existing ten-finger QWERTY keyboards with multi-touch gestural input that can exist as a complement to the moded-keyboard approach. To inform our design, we conducted a study to elicit user-defined gestures from 20 participants. The final gesture set includes both multi-touch and single-touch gestures for commonly used non-alphanumeric text input. We implemented and conducted a preliminary evaluation of a touch-screen keyboard augmented with this technique. Findings show that using gestures for non-alphanumeric input is no slower than using keys, and that users strongly prefer gestures to a moded-keyboard interface. ","1.

Participants completed tasks in one of two conditions, where the task-relevant information either appeared salient or non-salient. Our analysis provides insights into relationships between saliency, focused attention, and affect. Participants reported more distraction in the non-salient condition, and non-salient information was slower to find than salient. Lack-of-saliency led to a negative impact on affect, while saliency maintained positive affect, suggesting its helpfulness. Participants reported that it was easier to focus in the salient condition, although there was no significant improvement in the focused attention scale rating. Finally, this study suggests user interest in the topic is a good predictor of focused attention, which in turn is a good predictor of positive affect. These results suggest that enhancing saliency of user-interested topics seems a good strategy for boosting user engagement.","1. I. Arapakis, J.M. Jose & P.D. Gray.

Of interest to website owner, entertainment-oriented or other, interested in understanding user engagement.","Lori McCay-Peet","mccay@dal.ca","The following report outlines the revisions we made to paper number 1071 �On Saliency, Affect and Focused Attention�  \  \ Based on the reviews, several revisions were made that addressed suggested changes regarding 1) paper clarity, 2) data analysis, and 3) implications and future work. Reviewers are identified (e.g., R1) where appropriate. \  \ 1) Paper clarity. Typos were corrected and stylistic improvements made based on many of R2 and R3�s detailed suggestions. The paragraph relating to the novel contributions of the paper was moved from the introduction to the conclusion as per R3�s suggestion. Tables 1 and 2 were collapsed into the text of the paper to save space and the remaining tables were formatted according to CHI2012 instructions.  \  \ Extraneous details were removed and other details added to improve clarity. For example, the rationale behind choosing 6 tasks for the study (R3) is now explained through the lessons learned in the pilot studies. The overview of the study protocol now indicates that no time constraints for task completion were imposed (R3). How the multivariate outliers were determined (R1) is now specified. Details were also added to explain how the hotspots in Figure 2 were created to augment the higher-level explanation we provided (R2). More explanation has been included in the discussion regarding immersion and flow to help shed light on study results (R2). As well, findings of a recent study by O�Brien (2011) on user engagement and online news were incorporated into the results due to their relevance to the study�s findings relating to webpage content and emotions.  \  \ 2) Data analysis. As indicated in our rebuttal, we made changes to the way in which data relating to perceived time was analysed. This is now reflected in the results of Hypothesis 3 as well as the discussion. As well, an additional test (Fisher�s exact test) was performed due to cell counts of less than five in Table 2 (Cross Tabulation of Easy to Focus and Condition); this test confirmed significance of the Chi-square results of the easy to focus question. \  \ 3) Implications and future work. Discussion of practical implications and future work was augmented as per reviewer comments (R2) as space permitted.  \ ","","user experience","","FormatComplete","","Honorable Mention","Sep 23 16:49",""

This paper picks up on these recent developments and further examines the impact and implication of using a bespoke technology platform within the context of providing shelter and basic social services to homeless mothers and their children. I build on findings from a previous system deployment by describing targeted changes made to the technology, the design impetus for making those changes, and the resulting impact those changes had on the relationship between shelter staff, residents, and the information they shared via the system. By way of the findings reported here, I continue to develop the framing of Deweyan publics as a way to scaffold an environmental approach to technology design in contexts with multiple and diverse stakeholders.

To help address this problem, we developed an application, ShutEye, which provides a peripheral display on the wall-paper of the user's mobile phone to promote awareness about recommended activities that promote good sleep quality. Based on preferences about the user's desired bed-time and activities' for example, consuming caffeine or performing vigorous exercise. ShutEye displays guidance about when engaging in those activities is likely to affect sleep without requiring any explicit interaction from the user. In this paper, we describe ShutEye and results from a four-week field study with 12 participants. Results indicate that a simple, recommendation-based peripheral display can be a very low-effort but still effective method for improving awareness of healthy sleep habits. We also provide recommendations about designing peripheral displays and extend insights for designing health-based mobile applications.","1. Addy, M. & Moran, J.M. 2000.

They are followed by a description of the changes we made to address each item. \  \ 1) Emphasize the description of the design.   \ We provided more details on how the interface and background image was developed in the ""SHUTEYE DESIGN"" section paragraph 2 page 4.  \  \ ""Before converging on the timeline design metaphor for the peripheral display, several other designs were considered. This included other metaphors for time, such as a polar clock and an hourglass. We also considered more abstract depictions for the sleep hygiene recommendations, similar to the interfaces in prior work for mobile information displays [6,10]. We conducted informal usability tests to evaluate the competing design and converged on the horizontal timeline design, because it was easiest to quickly interpret."" \  \ 2) Add the discussion that you mentioned in the rebuttal regarding  validity of the results.  \ We included a discussion of the gender differences in the section entitled ""Participants"". We also included an additional footnote (National Sleep Foundation.  \ http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/sleep-topics/women-and-sleep) that supports our claim about gender differences in sleep related concerns.  \  \ ""Eight of the participants were female and four were male. The higher number of female participants is likely due to a higher number of women in general reporting difficulties sleeping. However, sleep hygiene recommendations are not gender specific, and thus we did not attempt to recruit an even number of males and females for the study."" \  \ We included more explanation about how participants were instructed on use of the phone in the ""Initial in-lab session"" section on page 5.   \  \ ""We gave them an in-depth tutorial on how to use the phone, imported their contacts, and provided the phone's user manual. "" \  \ We also cite their familiarity with the phones as a potential short coming in the ""Opportunities for Future Research"" (page 10).  \  \ ""This may also help to mitigate issues that could arise from participants using phones provided by the research team instead of their own phone."" \  \ 3) Include discussion of the limitations of the measurement of awareness  in the study. \ In the section ""Opportunities for Future Research"" (page 10 paragraph 1) we included a discussion of the issues involved in measuring awareness and provided information on how future studies could account for these short comings. \  \ ""Logging participants' use of ShutEye was problematic because the main form of interaction occurred peripherally when the users glanced at their phones, and thus this activity could not be accurately logged. ShutEye has been released on the Android Marketplace with a supplemental survey to collect data from a large set of users to make additional iterations on the application's design."" \  \ 4) Include a discussion on why the researched focused on awareness. \ in section ""Study Method"" (Page 4) we included a discussion of why we focused on awareness in this study as opposed to behavioral change. \  \ ""We focused on encouraging awareness rather than behavior change because it gave us the opportunity to understand a very sensitive and relatively new domain for HCI. Our approach was based on Klasnja et al.'s recommendations [17] for evaluating novel technologies promoting health behavior change. Klasnja et al. argue that due to the complexity of long-term behavior change, one should not focus on measuring behavior change itself while technology is still exploratory, but instead focus on understanding why and how technologies might eventually be effective in promoting change. This calls for a study that is mostly qualitative."" \  \ To make space for the edits listed above we removed some quotes and shortened the information in table 1.

Discusses challenges in annotating dynamic and hierarchical data.","Micheline Elias","michellelias@gmail.com","Based on the very helpful comments from our reviewers, our meta and secondary, we have updated our paper in the following ways (please see change ""Other Changes"" for strategies used to acquire space). \  \ Content: \  \ - We altered our Discussions section (page 9) to address the main point raised in reviews regarding the relevance of the work's contribution to other visualization systems and the broader HCI community (all reviewers). Following our rebuttal our Discussion now explains how:  \  \ 1. our requirements and designs can aid different types of visualization systems (paragraph 1) \ 2. our general data and querying annotations can be applied to interactive data achieving applications (paragraph 2).  \ Previous content related to automatic annotation has been moved to the section Automated Annotation (part of How to Use Context) \  \ - As suggested by our meta, R2, R3 we reorganized our results section to follow the task descriptions (page 8). The content is largely the same, we just added when possible clarifications requested by our reviewers (e.g. In ""Results - Supporting Analysis - T3"" we clarified that 5 experts found our similarity metrics enough, but 2 would have also liked text similarity metrics (R3)). \  \ - We expanded our related work section (end of paragraph 2, beginning of paragraph 1) to include references to work such as the Data-frame theory of sense making [Klein et al.], social sense making (used an example of [Nelson et al.]) and challenges on sense making in visual analytics ([Attfield et al.]). We further explained how our work connects to this and other systems (R1) by adding more references within the main description of our system (sections Prototype & How to Use Context). \  \ - As suggested by our secondary, we added a reference on the importance of using annotation for cross-linking content [Tashman et al.] and being able to move from annotations to data and back (How to Use Context - Chart Linking). \  \ - Finally, we clarified a point raised by our secondary regarding users being required to specify advanced annotation properties, such as timelife and granularity. We altered our wording slightly in the section ""Design Challenges and Solutions"" to stress that this is optional functionality and the system provides reasonable defaults. \  \ Other Changes: \  \ - Moved to a more compact text editor (from word to latex), this saved us immediately space we used for a bigger version of Figure 1 and most of the changes mentioned above. Other space saving strategies we used was: condensing repeated wording (as pointed out by R1) as well as our bibliography format; and removed 2 references that were accidentally present in the document, that we did not point to from the text. \  \ - Rearranged content in page 1-2 (but did minor content changes to improve readability) to fit a bigger version of figure 1, as requested by reviewers (R1,R2 & R3) \  \ - Enhanced the resolution of all figures in the paper, and enlarged the font size in Figure 3. \  \ - Corrected small typos indicated by all reviewers (grammatical and Figure references), as well as ones we found in our final pass. \  \ - Made our reference format consistent (R1 & R2). \ ","","design, user experience","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 17:44",""

We designed an interactive installation that uses visual feedback to the incidental movements of passers-by to communicate its interactivity. The lab study reveals: (1) Mirrored user silhouettes and images are more effective than avatar-like representations. (2) It takes time to notice the interactivity (approx. 1.2s). In the field study, three displays were installed during three weeks in shop windows, and data about 502 interaction sessions were collected. Our observations show: (1) Significantly more passers-by interact when immediately showing the mirrored user image (+90%) or silhouette (+47%) compared to a traditional attract sequence with call-to-action. (2) Passers-by often notice interactivity late and have to walk back to interact (the landing effect). (3) If somebody is already interacting, others begin interaction behind the ones already interacting, forming multiple rows. Our findings can be used to design public display applications and shop windows that more effectively communicate interactivity to passers-by.","1. Brignull, H., and Rogers, Y.

However, their lack of scalability is a major challenge for their wide adoption. In this paper, we present Gesture Marks, a novel approach to touch-gesture interaction that allows a user to access applications and websites using gestures without having to define them first. It offers two distinctive solutions to address the problem of scalability. First, it leverages the ""wisdom of the crowd"", a continually evolving library of gesture shortcuts that are collected from the user population, to infer the meaning of gestures that a user never defined himself. Second, it combines an extensible template-based gesture recognizer with a specialized handwriting recognizer to even better address handwriting-based gestures, which are a common form of gesture shortcut. These approaches effectively bootstrap a user's personal gesture library, alleviating the need to define most gestures manually. Our work was motivated and validated via a series of user studies, and the findings from these studies add to the body of knowledge on gesture-based interaction.","1.

Our findings show the conditions under which distributed sensemaking can improve sensemaking quality; that a user's sensemaking process is readily apparent to a subsequent user via a knowledge map; and that the organization of content was more useful to subsequent users than the content itself, especially when those users had differing goals.  We discuss the role distributed sensemaking can play in schema induction by helping users make a mental model of an information space and make recommendations for new tool and system development.","1.

However, if exercise partners have different fitness levels then the activity can be too strenuous for one and not challenging enough for the other, compromising engagement and health benefits. Our system, Jogging over a Distance, uses heart rate data and spatialized sound to create an equitable, balanced experience between joggers of different fitness levels who are geographically distributed. We extend this prior work by analyzing the experience of 32 joggers to detail how specific design features facilitated, and hindered, an engaging and balanced exertion experience. With this knowledge, we derive four dimensions that describe a design space for balancing exertion experiences: Measurement, Adjustment, Presentation and Control. We also present six design tactics for creating balanced exertion experiences described by these dimensions. By aiding designers in supporting participants of different physical abilities, we hope to increase participation and engagement with physical activity and facilitate the many benefits it brings about.","1.

We made a pair of CheekTouch prototypes each with a multi-touch screen and vibrotactile display to enable bidirectional touch delivery. We observed four romantic couples in their twenties using our prototype system in a lab setting over five consecutive days, and analyzed how CheekTouch affected their non-verbal and emotional communication. The results of the user study showed that CheekTouch could effectively support audio-tactile communication in various ways - persuading, conveying status, delivering information, emphasizing emotion/words, calling for attention, and being playful.

We introduce WalkType, an adaptive text entry system that leverages the mobile device�s built-in tri-axis accelerometer to compensate for extraneous movement while walking. WalkType�s classification model uses the displacement and acceleration of the device, and inference about the user�s footsteps. Additionally, WalkType models finger-touch location and finger distance traveled on the screen, features that increase overall accuracy regardless of movement. The final model was built on typing data collected from 16 participants. In a study comparing WalkType to a control condition, WalkType reduced uncorrected errors by 45.2% and increased typing speed by 12.9% for walking participants.","1.

Such questions can be difficult to address well, and a principled approach can clarify issues of both theory and practice.  One such approach is Value Sensitive Design (VSD), an established theory and method for addressing issues of values in a systematic and principled fashion in the design of information technology.  In this essay, we suggest however that the theory and at times the presentation of VSD overclaims in a number of key respects, with the result of inhibiting its more widespread adoption and appropriation.  We address these issues by suggesting four topics for next steps in the evolution of VSD: (1) tempering VSD�s position on universal values; (2) contextualizing existing and future lists of values that are presented as heuristics for consideration; (3) strengthening the voice of the participants in publications describing VSD investigations; and (4) making clearer the voice of the researchers.  We propose new or altered approaches for VSD that address these issues of theory, voice, and reportage.","1. Albrechtslund, A. Ethics and technology design. Ethics and Info.

The challenges of organizing and evaluating a potentially large amount of data can be overcome through the use of annotations (title, tags, and audio notes). We created Zydeco, a multi-component system that students use to collect annotated multimedia data from a museum (using a smartphone app), and then create a scientific explanation with their personal and peers' data (using a tablet app). We ran a classroom study with 54 students (ages 11-13) investigating how students searched for, evaluated, and used annotated data to construct a scientific explanation. We found that tags supported data interpretation, while title searching and panning through the unfiltered data set supported finding and using data.","1.

Current approaches to automatic screen rotation are based on gravity and device orientation. Our survey of 513 users shows that 42% currently experience auto-rotation that leads to incorrect viewing orientation several times a week or more, and 24% find the problem to be very serious to extremely serious. iRotate augments gravity-based approach, and uses front cameras on mobile devices to detect users' faces and rotates screens accordingly. It requires no explicit user input and supports different user postures and device orientations. We have implemented a iRotate that works in real-time on iPhone and iPad, and we assess the accuracy and limitations of iRotate through a 20- participant feasibility study.","1.

Yes, I recognize that it is in the title, but the clarification in the text will bring out the contribution. \  \ We have restructured and refocused the introduction to clarify that our focus in this work is expertise selection. We also made sure that other parts of the paper including the related work, the discussion, and the conclusion further emphasize the point. \  \ 2.	From our rebuttal: R2 expresses a concern that �the honest result here is that the enhanced system did NOT lead to higher quality choices,� which we believe is due to a lack of clarity in our presentation of the data. We will make sure that we discuss the statistical meaning of our findings correctly in the text to allow readers to correctly interpret our data. \  \ We made sure to make it clear when we report our findings, which finds were and which weren�t statistically significant and appropriately interpret these for the reader, e.g.: �We found non-statistically significant evidence that the experimental condition led to better quality choices: on average, experts selected in the experimental condition were more likely to respond to the inquiry, more likely to consider themselves an appropriate expert to address the query, and more likely to be able to introduce the participant to others who may be able to help with the inquiry (the middle three rows of Table 3). Note that while none of these measures reach the level of significance allowing us to reject the null hypothesis, the results do provide evidence that additional information in the search results may be the factor responsible for the better performance. Since the number of participants in this study was low for a quantitative investigation, more conclusive results might be seen in a larger investigation.� \  \ 3.	From our rebuttal: As R2 suggested, we will expand the section that presents our explanation of the counterintuitive finding that more information leads to faster selection: because all relevant information is on the same page, it allows quicker scanning, use of the within page �find� function, and quicker comparisons between experts. \  \ New text reads: �In the experimental condition, participants on average decided on an expert more quickly (see Table 3). We noticed three differences in how participants went about making this decision. First, because all the information was on the same page, rather than requiring click-through, participant were able to more quickly scan through the expertise summaries and status messages for matched search terms. Second, several participants used the browser find function to search for specific keywords within the results page, which quickly highlighted some experts to examine first. Lastly, having all the information on the same page, reduced the effort to find each piece of evidence for selecting an expert and allowed for easier comparison between suggested experts, which led to participants considering and citing more sources of evidence for their choice without spending more time to identify this information.� \  \ 4.	From our rebuttal: As R3 suggests, we will expand the discussion of how the profile may be re-conceptualized. \  \ We added in the discussion: �Additionally, it may be beneficial for designers to re-conceptualize the profile page from a static display describing a colleague in general terms to one that considers the specific needs and goals of the information seeker: foregrounding most relevant information for the query task and topic and highlighting occurrences of relevant search terms.� \  \ In addition to the changes above, we made a number of smaller changes throughout the text of the paper to conform to the archival format, to un-anonymize the submission, to clarify wording, and to reduce to 10 pages. \ ","","","ContentComplete","FormatComplete","","","Sep 22 21:56",""

Video feeds are simulated using a game engine.  While locating targets within a 3D terrain using a 2D 360-degree interface, participants indicated perceived egocentric directions to targets and later placed targets on an overhead view of the terrain.  Interfaces were compared based on target finding and map placement performance.  Results suggest 1) non-seamless interfaces with visual boundaries facilitate spatial understanding, 2) correct perception of self-to-object relationships is not correlated with understanding object-to-object relationships within the environment, and 3) increased video game experience corresponds with better spatial understanding of an environment observed in 360-degrees.

However, few studies have focused on the perceived risks of posting photos online and even fewer have examined the risks associated with provocative, controversial, or deeply personal images.

These roles require agents to closely monitor the behavioral, emotional, and mental states of their users and provide appropriate, effective responses. Educational agents, for example, will have to monitor student attention and seek to improve it when student engagement decreases. In this paper, we draw on techniques from brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and knowledge from educational psychology to design adaptive agents that monitor student attention in real time using measurements from electroencephalography (EEG) and recapture diminishing attention levels using verbal and nonverbal cues. An experimental evaluation of our approach showed that an adaptive robotic agent employing behavioral techniques to regain attention during drops in engagement improved student recall abilities 43% over the baseline regardless of student gender and significantly improved female motivation and rapport. Our findings offer guidelines for developing effective adaptive agents, particularly for educational settings.","WARNING: Reference 4 is very long.  Please check it. \  \ 1.

As a possible method for decreasing rates of obesity, we focused on controlling food intake implicitly without any effort. \ We hypothesized that ambiguous perception of satiety can be applied to control our food intake. Recent psychological studies have revealed that the amount of food consumed is influenced by both its actual volume and external factors during eating. Based on this knowledge, we sought to control perception of satiety gained from the same amount of food by changing its apparent size. We also proposed a method for food-volume augmentation using real-time shape deformation. Our results suggest that this augmentation can control the perception of satiety and food intake.   \ ","1.

TTP uses lightweight video recordings to pre-record your contributions to a meeting, which are played on a tablet that serves as a proxy for you during the meeting. Reactions and responses in the meeting are also captured in video to give you feedback of what happened at the meeting. A working prototype of TTP was deployed and studied within four developer teams in their daily stand-up meetings. The study found that the affordances of video helped integrate the time traveler into the social context of the meeting, although the current prototype was better at enabling the time traveler to contribute to the meeting than it was in conveying the meeting experience back to the time traveler.","1.

This focuses the paper on a more specific kind of meeting, although we reflect on the desire to generalize to other meetings in future work. \ �	Consolidated design rationale in the description of TTP. \ �	Explanation of why we characterize data with medians due to some outlier data which skew the means. Clarification of the t-test used to report the statistically significant difference on the survey responses, which is one of the few questions with a significant difference. Also added significant differences to the averages. \ �	In the Reflection section, organized our observations according to observations about video as a medium (in general) and then about specific features of TTP (avatar video, asymmetries of usage). \ �	Careful copy editing to clean up typographical and grammatical errors in the submission. \  \ We hope these changes reflect the intent of the reviewers, and thank you for the constructive feedback. \ ","","design, user experience","ContentComplete","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 14:09",""

In lab studies, participants are presented with prescribed tasks, enabling easy identification of speeds and errors. In everyday use, no such prescriptions exist. We devised novel algorithms to segment text entry and mouse pointing input streams into �trials.� We are the first to measure errors for unprescribed text entry and mouse pointing. To measure errors, we utilize web search engines, adaptive offline dictionaries, an Automation API, and crowdsourcing. Capturing errors allows us to employ Crossman�s (1957) speed-accuracy normalization when calculating Fitts� law throughputs. To validate the Input Observer, we compared its measures from 12 participants over a week of computer use to the same participants� results from a lab study. Overall, in the lab and field, average text entry speeds were 74.47 WPM and 80.59 WPM, respectively. Average uncorrected error rates were near zero, at 0.12% and 0.28%. For mouse pointing, average movement times were 971 ms and 870 ms. Average pointing error rates were 4.42% and 4.66%. Average throughputs were 3.48 bits/s and 3.45 bits/s. Device makers, researchers, and assistive technology specialists may benefit from measures of everyday use.","1. Anderson, T.W. and Darling, D.A. (1954). A test of goodness of fit. J.

This paper examines how initial topical focus influences communities' ability to attract a critical mass. When starting an online community, organizers need to define its initial scope. Topically narrow communities will probably attract a homogeneous group of interested in its content and compatible with each other. However, they are likely to attract fewer members than a diverse one because they offer only a subset of the topics. This paper reports an empirical analysis of longitudinal data collected from Twitter, where each new Twitter poster is considered the seed of a potential social collection. Users who focus the topics of their early tweets more narrowly ultimately attract more followers with more ties among them.

However, little is known about how this shift might shape people�s orientations toward their digital things. To investigate, we conducted in depth interviews with 13 people comparing and contrasting how they think about their possessions, moving from physical ones, to locally kept digital materials, to the online world. Findings are interpreted to detail design and research opportunities in this emerging space. ","1.	Barkhuss, L., Tashiro, J. 2010. Student socialization in the age of facebook.

Simulations based on log records of real user interaction across a diverse range of applications show that AccessRank more accurately predicts upcoming accesses than other algorithms. The prediction lists generated by AccessRank are also shown to be more stable than other algorithms that have good predictive capability, which can be important for usability when items are presented in lists as users can rely on their spatial memory for target location.

We present GyroTab, a relatively flat handheld system that utilizes the gyro effect to provide torque feedback. GyroTab relies on the user to produce an input torque and provides feedback by opposing that torque, making its feedback reactive to the user�s motion.

To do this, we generate an inaudible tone, which gets frequency-shifted when it reflects off moving objects like the hand. We measure this shift with the microphone to infer various gestures. In this note, we describe the phenomena and detection algorithm, demonstrate a variety of gestures, and present an informal evaluation on the robustness of this approach across different devices and people.

","Md Munirul Haque","md.haque@mu.edu","As R2 suggested some explanations of the fluctuations in visits would be helpful.  \ we have added the following sentences-  \ It is to be noted that the local doctors have been operating since 2nd week of August when the foreign doctors left. Also November to January is the winter season in Bangladesh and the percentage of missed appointments is much less in Dec �11 (42%) compared to that of Dec �10 (58%). This indicates that the drop in percentage of missed appointments is not just due to external factors like foreign doctors or weather. \ (Though we first deployed e-ESAS in mid June �11, here we publish result starting from Nov �11 due to delayed BMRC (Bangladesh Medical Research Council) clearance.) \  \ Graphs should be clearly labelled. Be careful about claims of significance, which has a statistical meaning.  \ Ans- Graphs have been labeled. \  \ Per R3, some discussion of sustainability would add to the paper.  \ We have added the following paragraph with tables to discuss the sustainability issues. \ We wanted to study the sustainability of our study when the project ends. We prepared a table to show the cost analysis of e-ESAS. Then we classified the patients in 3 groups: a) patients with high end mobile where e-ESAS application can be deployed, b) patients with Java enabled mobiles, and c) patients with non Java enabled mobiles. On an average BDT 1.02 is needed to submit e-ESAS information each time. So each patient of the 1st group needs only 31 taka (USD 0.41) each month to submit e-ESAS once a day. The patients of 2nd and 3rd group can use our proposed SMS based system. For 30 SMSs patients need around BDT 5 (USD 0.07). Those who do not have Java enabled mobile need a onetime purchase cost of around BDT 3500 (USD 48). We detailed this information to the patients and ask them whether they will be willing to bear this cost by themselves at the end of the study. The answers have been summarized in a table. \  \ The authors do not provide enough descriptive detail about their users  \ Ans- We have added the following demographic information.  \ Patients� ages ranged from 21 to 45 years and education varied from illiterate to high school. 34.9% of the patients were illiterate. 87.1% of the patients came from a family with monthly income less than 84.5 dollars. Twenty nine patients were having breast cancer for the first time and 10 having for the second time. Finally, it would be interesting to note that almost 96% patients said that they have access to cell phone which belongs to themselves or to some members of the family. \ As per the suggestion of R3 we have incorporated one usability graph in this paper. It shows the time required by patients and attendants to complete e-ESAS. \ ","","design, user experience, health","","FormatComplete","","Honorable Mention","Sep 23 19:48",""

With sampleAction we have explored whether interaction techniques to present query results running over only incremental samples can be presented as sufficiently trustworthy for analysts both to make closer to real time decisions about their queries and to be more exploratory in their questions of the data. Our work with three teams of analysts suggests that we can indeed accelerate and open up the query process with such incremental visualizations. ","1. S. Chaudhuri and U. Dayal.

We suggest that serendipity can be facilitated through visualization. To explore this, we introduce the Bohemian Bookshelf, which aims to support serendipitous discoveries in the context of digital book collections. The Bohemian Bookshelf consists of five interlinked visualizations each offering a unique overview of the collection. It aims at encouraging serendipity by (1) offering multiple visual access points to the collection, (2) highlighting adjacencies between books, (3) providing flexible visual pathways for exploring the collection, (4) enticing curiosity through abstract, metaphorical, and visually distinct representations of books, and (5) enabling a playful approach to information exploration. A deployment at a library revealed that visitors embraced this approach of utilizing visualization to support open-ended explorations and serendipitous discoveries. This encourages future explorations into promoting serendipity through information visualization.","1. Andr´e, P., schraefel, m. c., Teevan, J., and Dumais, S. T.

","Uta Hinrichs and Alice Thudt","uhinrich@ucalgary.ca","In the following, we list all revisions that we have made according to the reviewers' comments. \  \ STRUCTURAL CHANGES \ **Sections ""Recommendations for Encouraging Serendipity"" and ""Design for Serendipity through Visualization"" merged. [AC] \ - As suggested by the AC, we have merged Subsection ""Recommendations for Encouraging Serendipity"" and Section ""Design for Serendipity through Visualization"" to eliminate redundancies. The merge Section is titled ""Design for Serendipity through Visualization"" and includes our design goals, specifically relevant for supporting serendipity through information visualization, each with a brief introductory paragraph of how they relate to previous and more recommendations from the literature. \  \ **Section ""Related Visualization Approaches"" moved to the beginning of the paper. [AC] \ - Following the AC�s advice, we have moved Section ""Related Visualization Approaches"" more to the beginning of the paper. It now follows the revised ""Designing for Serendipity through Visualization"" section. \  \ MOTIVATION FOR CHOSEN VISUALIZATIONS [AC, 2AC, R1, R2] \ - Addressing an important point raised by the reviewers, we have clarified our motivations for the visualizations included in the Bohemian Bookshelf and the book attributes that they are based on at the beginning of Section ""The Bohemian Bookshelf Visualization"". \ > Our design choices are based on informal conversations with librarians as well as previous literature [42,45]. We revised the introductory paragraph as follows: One of the best known ways of finding books serendipitously is through location and proximity to a given book on a bookshelf [14, 19, 46]. Furthermore, previous literature [42, 45] as well as our informal discussions with librarians revealed that physical and visual attributes play a big role during open-ended explorations of book collections. This guided our choice of book attributes to visualize in the Bohemian Bookshelf: we aimed at providing a variety of perspectives or facets [52] on the book collection to increase the number of possible adjacencies by leveraging content-related as well as physical characteristics of books. We included one attribute commonly used for physical adjacencies (ordering by author), one commonly used for digital search (content-related keywords), one physical attribute often neglected in digital libraries (page count), one emphasizing the visual appearance of the book (cover colour & thumbnail image), and one that juxtaposes books' temporal aspects (content era and publication year). Thus, the Bohemian Bookshelf  (see Fig. 1) offers 5 possible adjacencies between books, instead of just one as in physical bookshelves, any of which might offer disparate types of serendipitous discoveries.  \  \ - We clarified our choice of visualizing books� cover colour in the Cover Colour Visualization (Section ""The Bohemian Bookshelf Visualization"", Subsection ""Cover Colour Circle""):  \ > Covers are often designed specifically to attract attention; previous research has found them to be decisive for the anticipated reading experience [42].  \  \ CLARIFICATIONS \ **The form of serendipitous discoveries we aim to support was clarified. [AC, 2AC] \ - We have changed the title of the paper to read ""The Bohemian Bookshelf: Supporting Serendipitous BOOK Discoveries through Information Visualization"" to clarify that we are not referring to scientific discoveries but to book discoveries in library collections. We also emphasized this in the Abstract and Introduction. \  \ **The introductory scenario was improved to be more convincing. [AC] \ - We have revised the introductory scenario to incorporate more realism (see ""Introduction"", paragraph 2):  \ > Consider this simple scenario. Lucy has planned a summer vacation and wants to enrich her time at the beach with a relaxing read... \  \ **Specifications about the factors influencing serendipity & recommendations [AC] \ - We added a note to Section ""Concept of Serendipity"" that it is unknown what factors influence serendipity the most (Section ""Concept of Serendipity"", last paragraph):  \ > While the specific impact of each of the factors listed above on serendipity is unknown, it becomes clear that there is more to serendipity than mere chance and coincidence. \  \ - We clarified that the list of recommendations we derived from the literature is targeted toward recommendations that can be accomplished through information technology (Section ""Design through Serendipity"", paragraph 1):  \ > The question of how serendipitous book discoveries can be facilitated through information technology is much discussed in library and information sciences [1, 4, 14, 50]. \  \ **Details about the size and character of our sample book collection. [AC] \ - We have added more details about the size and character of our sample book collection (Section ""The Bohemian Bookshelf"", paragraph 2):  \ > The Bohemian Bookshelf is based on a collection of 250 books retrieved from the Open Library project, and covers mostly the genres history and fiction. \  \ FIELD STUDY DETAILS \ **Details about participant sample & study questions. [AC, 2AC, R1, R2] \ - We included additional details about our participant sample, including demographics and interaction times (Section ""Library Deployment of the Bohemian Bookshelf"", paragraph 1):  \ > We took field notes of visitors' interactions and interviewed 11 visitors (6 male, 5 female; age approx. 20 to 60) who had interacted with the display for at least 30 seconds. [...] Average interactions times were 1:06 min (interviewed visitors: 1:59 min) with a maximum interaction time of 6:26 min (interviewed visitors: 3:39 min). Such seemingly brief interaction times are realistic in libraries where visitors often approach information displays spontaneously. \  \ - We added details about the questions we included in the interviews with library visitors (Section ""Library Deployment of the Bohemian Bookshelf"", paragraph 1):  \ > The interviews included questions regarding visitors' initial motivations to approach the Bohemian Bookshelf; their overall experience of the visualizations; fulfillment of eventual expectations; potential book discoveries; and general book browsing and information seeking habits. \  \ **Details about visitors' serendipitous book discoveries. [R1, R3] \ - We added a separate subsection ""Serendipitous Book Discoveries"" to Section ""Serendipity and the Bohemian Bookshelf"" where we expand on serendipitous book discoveries reported by library visitors (Section ""Serendipity and the Bohemian Bookshelf"", last subsection):  \ > Six of the visitors we interviewed explicitly mentioned that they made personal serendipitous discoveries while interacting with the Bohemian Bookshelf. Three participants explained that they found a book by selecting their favourite colour. Others stated that a book's cover, title or author caught their eye when browsing the catalogue: ""I had no expectations and I just saw a [author] name that seemed familiar to my language, and then I thought, well, why not check it [the book] out."" [A11]. The participants named book titles they found interesting and sometimes wanted to check them out from the library. This is remarkable considering visitors' spontaneous use of the Bohemian Bookshelf and the short interaction times. These encouraging initial results indicate that visitors embraced the concepts inherent in the Bohemian Bookshelf of supporting open-ended browsing of book collections and serendipity through information visualization. \  \ **Details about visitors� interactions and preferences regarding the Bohemian Bookshelf. [R1] \ - We added some details about visitors' interactions and preferences regarding the Bohemian Bookshelf that we observed during our field study (Section ""Serendipity and the Bohemian Bookshelf"")  \ Subsection ""Providing Multiple Access Points"":  \ > Our interviews and observations of visitors' interactions revealed that the personal preferences regarding search criteria and the visualizations of the Bohemian Bookshelf were diverse... \  \ Subsection ""Flexible Visual Pathways as Serendipitous Guides"":  \ > We also observed visitors deliberately steering their exploration along ""outlier"" books that visually stood out within the visualizations. For instance, visitors frequently explored particularly large or small books in the Book Pile or isolated connecting lines in the Timelines visualization. \ ","","design, user experience","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 17:57",""

The station combines a physical platform allowing children with CP to provide pedaling input into a game, a standard Xbox 360 controller, and algorithms for interpreting the cycling input to improve smoothness and accuracy of gameplay. The station was designed through an iterative and incremental participatory design process involving medical professionals, game designers, computer scientists, kinesiologists, physical therapists, and eight children with CP. It has been tested through observation of its use, through gathering opinions from the children, and through small experimental studies. With our initial design, only three of eight children were capable of playing a cycling-based game; with the final design, seven of eight could cycle effectively, and six reached energy expenditure levels recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine while pedaling unassisted.","1.

In doing so, the contribution of the paper is twofold: we wish to highlight some aspects of the every-day life of institutionalized elderly people � trust, sociality, and memory � which not only provoke reflection on design ideas but also on the socio-technical nexus in which design for the elderly has to take place. This domain, we suggest, is one where the �parachuting in� of technology is unlikely to prove successful, for reasons we examine below. Further, we suggest that design for and with the elderly carries with it some specific problems. We illustrate our methodological reflections by means of an ongoing empirical research project which aims at the development of a large-screen display for a residential care home. ","1.

Building on theory from areas including philosophy and design theory, this paper articulates a theoretical framework for conceptualizing the intentional negation of technology (i.e., the undesign of technology), ranging from the inhibition of particular uses of technology to the total erasure or foreclosure of technology. The framework is then expanded upon to articulate additional areas of undesigning, including self-inhibition, exclusion, removal, replacement, restoration, and safeguarding. In conclusion a scheme is offered for addressing questions concerning the disciplinary scope of undesign in the context of HCI, along with suggestions for ways that undesigning may be more strongly incorporated within HCI research.","1.

Concretely, our approach leverages a family of languages closely related to the speaker's native language to construct translations in a coherent mix of these languages. Experimental results indicate that these translations can be easily understood, being also a useful aid for users who are not proficient in foreign languages.

This paper reports on the iterative design process and two in-the-wild evaluations of the 4Decades game, which was developed for a whole classroom of students to engage with a climate simulation. The system allows students to play and change the rules of the simulation, thereby enabling them to be actively engaged at different levels. The notion of Contributory Simulations is proposed as an instructional model that empowers groups to make informed, critical changes to the underlying scientific model.

We elaborate on specific elements of the ecology and their role for collaboration. In particular, we point out how collaboration at multiple levels was supported through specific constraints, using the recent HCI framework ""mechanics for collaboration"" by Yuill & Rogers (2012).

A popular example in the software development domain is Eclipse, a flexible devel-opment environment that can be extended with literally thousands of different plug-ins. However, searching, in-stalling and configuring new plug-ins requires complex overhead work that is only weakly addressed by existing support mechanisms. Recent research has highlighted the related practices of learning about new plug-ins and tailor-ing software tools as being highly cooperative, situated, socially embedded, and often connected to particular work situations. Based on an empirical study in small software enterprises, we develop an understanding of appropriation as a social and collaborative activity. We then suggest de-sign principles for appropriation support that are grounded in the practices we have found in the field, and present a prototypical implementation of the concept that extends existing mechanisms of sharing tools and tool-knowledge.","1.

We present virtual projection (VP), an interaction metaphor inspired by how we intuitively control the position, size, and orientation of a handheld optical projector�s image. VP is based on tracking a handheld device without an optical projector and allows selecting a target display on which to position, scale, and orient an item in a single gesture. By relaxing the optical projection metaphor, we can deviate from modeling perspective projection, for example, to con-strain scale or orientation, create multiple copies, or offset the image. VP also supports dynamic filtering based on the projection frustum, creating overview and detail applications, and selecting portions of a larger display for zooming and panning. We show exemplary use cases implemented using our optical feature-tracking framework and present the results of a user study demonstrating the effectiveness of VP in complex interactions with large displays.

We were interested in the potential of asynchronous video to augment children�s close friendships and what types of activities they would engage in using video. We explored both of these concepts through a 9-week field study with a group of six 9-10 year old girls. We see children as potential media trendsetters when it comes to video communication given their comfort with video and desire for rich social interactions. The results from this study were striking. Despite having frequent face-to-face interactions, the girls used our asynchronous video communication tool extensively to augment their existing relationships. Not only were they able to have rich conversations using asynchronous video, they also demonstrated a strong desire to share more than just a �talking head�. The results from this work point to the need for video mediated communication to move beyond conversations, to the sharing of rich experiences. ","1.

These examples couple the concrete functionality of code with rich contextual information about how the code works. However, using these examples necessitates understanding, configuring, and integrating the code, all of which typically take place after the example enters the user's code and has been removed from its original instructive context. In short, a user's interaction with an example continues well after the code is pasted. This paper investigates whether treating examples as ""first-class"" objects in the code editor - rather than simply as strings of text - will allow programmers to use examples more effectively. We explore this through the creation and evaluation of Codelets. A Codelet is presented inline with the user's code, and consists of a block of example code and an interactive helper widget that assists the user in understanding and integrating the example. The Codelet persists throughout the example's lifecycle, remaining accessible even after configuration and integration is done. A comparative laboratory study with 20 participants found that programmers were able to complete tasks involving examples an average of 43% faster when using Codelets than when using a standard Web browser.","1.

An example is a personal telepresence robot, which acts as a physical proxy for a remote visitor, and uses cameras and microphones to capture its surroundings, which are transmitted back to the visitor. We propose the use of spherical displays to represent telepresent visitors at a destination. We suggest that the use of such 360 degree displays in a telepresence system has two key advantages: it is possible to understand the identity of the visitor from any viewpoint; and with suitable graphical representation, it is possible to tell where the visitor is looking from any viewpoint. In this paper, we investigate how to optimally represent a visitor as an avatar on a spherical display by evaluating how varying representations are able to accurately convey head gaze.","1.

It has been hypothesized to support collaborative sensemaking. In this paper, we examine some of the cognitive mechanisms assumed to underlie sensemaking, namely social imitation processes. We present a multinomial model that is applied to the generation of tags. In line with the semantic imitation model of Fu and colleagues, we assume that implicit processing can be understood as a semantic reconstruction of gist. Our model contrasts this process with a recall of tags from an explicit verbatim memory trace. We tested this model in an experimental study in which after the search task students had to generate tags themselves. We exposed their answers to a multinomial model derived from Fuzzy Trace Theory to obtain independent parameter estimates for the processes of explicit recall, semantic gist reconstruction and familiarity-based recall. As it turns out, a model that assumes all processes are at play explains the data well. Similar to results of our previous study, we find an influence of search intentions on the two processes. Our results have implications for interface and interaction design of social tagging systems, as well as for tag recommendation in these environments.","WARNING: Reference 37 is very long.

This dilemma has inspired researchers to use virtual environments (VEs) to acquire control while offering the user a rich contextual experience. Although promising, these studies are mainly concerned with usability and the technical realization of their setup. Furthermore, previous setups leave room for improvement regarding the user's immersive experience. This paper contributes to this line of research by presenting a UX case study on mobile advertising with a novel CAVE-smartphone interface. We conducted two experiments in which we evaluated the intrusiveness of a mobile location-based advertising app in a virtual supermarket. The results confirm our hypothesis that context-congruent ads lessen the experienced intrusiveness thereby demonstrating that our setup is capable of generating preliminary meaningful results with regards to UX. Furthermore, we share insights in conducting these studies.","1. Abowd, G. and Mynatt, E. Charting past, present and future research in ubiquitous computing. ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum.

In particular the contribution should be presented as a case study; the motivation and results of the case study should be better tied to previous studies of mobile advertisement and consumer behaviour; the methodology should be better tied to prior literature on ""alternative"" evaluation methods. \  \ In the first place we repositioned this study as a case study. This is stated in the introduction and throughout the rest of the paper. We emphasize that the case study contributes to HCI as well as to the field of advertising research. Regarding the former we mention the extending of VE aided evaluation to the field of UX and the introduction of a setup with a distinct combination of properties. With respect to the latter we propose that the case study gives insights how these novel tools within the field of HCI can potentially contribute to advertising research. \  \ To better connect the motivation for this case study to the field of advertising research we added the paragraph 'Mobile advertising research' and framed our introduction more in the context of (mobile) advertising. Furthermore we extended the advertising literature with the following references: \  \ Banerjee, S. and Dholakia, R.R. Mobile advertising: does location-based advertising work?

This resulted in the following text:  \  \ The experiments took place within a virtual supermarket simulated by a CAVE. A supermarket seemed to be the most suitable setting since mobile ads are more effective if they are aimed at low-priced and frequently bought products (Barwise & Strong, 2002). The VE (modelled in Maya and rendered in OGRE) is projected onto four rear- projection screens (each 3.6 meters wide by 2.6 meters high). The screens form a closed space, thereby offering the participant a 360° view of the environment. Participants can move in the virtual setting with the help of a head-tracking system based on 4 Wii-mote infrared cameras. In contrast with head-mounted displays, the CAVE does not block out the physical world, which offers the opportunity to use physical objects and the representation of the participant's own physical body. In this particular case, it gave us the possibility to use an actual smartphone, with which participants were able to receive location-based ads. The tracking device (see Figure 1) determines the participant's head position in the physical room, which is then used to control motion in the virtual supermarket. In essence, the participant acts as a ""human joystick"": when the participant stands in the centre of the CAVE the virtual camera stands still, whereas when the participant takes one step in a certain direction, the virtual camera moves accordingly, thus giving the illusion of movement within the virtual space. The participant is able to turn and step in every direction relative to the CAVE's centre. The simulation is also sensitive to the magnitude of the participant's distance from the centre of the physical room. This distance, determines the speed with which a participant walks within the environment. The simulation also corrects the first person view for the vertical axis. Thus, in the case in which the user, for example, jumped or ducked the simulation corrected the perspective according to the vertical position of the participant's head. When it comes to shopping within the supermarket our simulation does not yet support interaction with the virtual products. To simulate the act of selecting groceries, the participants were asked to make a grabbing gesture, without actually attempting to interact with the virtual product (Figure 1). If the participant made this grabbing gesture, the participant received auditory feedback. \  \ Furthermore, we extended the figures with a graphic of the floor plan of the virtual supermarket and screenshots of the mobile ads that were used for the experiments.  \  \  \ 3) critically assess the work, findings and their contribution particular w.r.t the literature. In particular the paper needs a more rigorous treatment of the pros and cons (threats to validity) of the method. \  \ In the first place we connect the findings to advertising research and the assessment of VE aided evaluation within our conclusion.  \  \ As justly stated by the reviewers, a critical evaluation of the method was largely missing in the initial version. To give a more thorough assessment of the shortcomings we extended our future work with the limitations of our study (See the extended 'Limitations and Future Work'). In this way we hope to connect future endeavors to current shortcomings. The threats to the external validity take a central place in our argument. \  \ Finally we also made corrections to the rest of the document to better reflect the reframing of the paper and to deal with typos, punctuation, spelling and grammar.   \  \ We hope these revisions reflect the conditions stated by the reviewers. \ ","","user experience","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 20:02",""

To explore the role of social media in the discussion of mental health issues, and with particular reference to insomnia and sleep disorders, a corpus of 18,901 messages - or Tweets - posted to the microblogging social media service Twitter were analysed using a mixed methods approach. We present a content analysis which revealed that Tweets that contained the word �insomnia� contained significantly more negative health information than a random sample, strongly suggesting that individuals were making disclosures about their sleep disorder. A subsequent thematic analysis then revealed two themes: coping with insomnia, and describing the experience of insomnia. We discuss these themes as well as the implications of our research for those in the interaction design community interested in integrating online social media systems in health interventions. ","1.

Design implications for social media based mental health interventions are inferred.","Sue Jamison-Powell","sjamisonpowell@lincoln.ac.uk","As per our rebuttal document, we have made the following changes: \  \ Clarification of data analysis. \  \ Rebuttal: �R2 queries our choice to compare insomnia-specific tweets with a non-specific sample in the quantitative analysis, instead of other health-related tweets. Our non-specific sample of tweets may well have included health related tweets. This intention of using a non-specific sample was to have a collection of tweets representative of the twitter activity from the same period that the insomnia-specific tweets were sampled. These were used as a control group to explore differences between insomnia specific tweets and the rest of twitter. We can emphasise this intention more strongly in a revision if the paper is accepted.� \  \ We have amended a paragraph under Data Collection emphasising the use of the non-specific group of tweets as a control group: \  \ �A content analysis of the insomnia tweets was used to confirm that individuals were using Twitter to disclose details of their sleep disorder. However, analysing only these tweets would not allow us to determine the unique characteristics of tweets about insomnia and how they differ from messages generally posted on Twitter. Therefore, for the purposes of comparison, a control group consisting of 1% of all tweets posted in the first 30 seconds of each hour over a 24-hour period were archived, producing 59,370 tweets.� \  \  \ Rebuttal: �We appreciate R2�s comments regarding figure 1 and would propose appending the coding categories to the figure to illustrate and clarify the process of data analysis in the qualitative analysis. We note R2�s uncertainty regarding the link between the quantitative and qualitative study and propose to clarify the purpose of the content analysis as a method of confirming that the tweeters using the  #insomnia hashtag were discussing a sleep disorder in order to examine the qualitative content of those tweets.

However, defining exactly which challenges are important and which aspects of gaming experience are affected is largely under-explored. In this paper, we investigate if altering the level of challenge in a videogame influences people's experience of immersion. Our first study demonstrates that simply increasing the physical demands of the game by requiring gamers to interact more with the game does not result in increased immersion.  In a further two studies, we use time pressure to make games more physically and cognitively challenging. We find that the addition of time pressure increases immersion as predicted.  We argue that the level of challenge experienced is an interaction between the level of expertise of the gamer and the cognitive challenge encompassed within the game.","1.

In particular we have included papers suggested by both R1and R2 resulting in an additional 7 references. \  \ The new �overview of the experiments� section also includes a paragraph that makes explicit that our experiments were not incremental but developed from a common basis and in parallel. \  \ We have added a paragraph to better discuss the manipulation in expt1. This discusses the need to manipulate physical challenge without reducing the usability of the game, and better describes how the game is �balanced� to require more actions, but not necessarily more thought, and makes explicit the hypotheses on this that are already tested in the analysis.  In addition, we more carefully discuss the relationship between the physical challenge and time pressure. \  \ We hope that you are happy with our efforts to revise our paper.

Standard metrics such as words per minute and keystrokes per character yield information only about the effectiveness of the technology and the interaction techniques developed for eye typing. We conducted an extensive study with almost five hours of eye typing per participant and report on extended qualitative and quantitative analysis of the relationship of dwell time, text entry rate, errors made, and workload experienced by the participants. The analysis method is comprehensive and stresses the need to consider different metrics in unison.

Through a study of 614 staff members at a large university, we show how social capital, network characteristics, and use of Facebook are related to how useful individuals find Facebook to be for informational purposes and their propensity to seek different types of information on the site. We find that bridging social capital and engagement with one’s network through directed communication behaviors are important predictors of these dimensions of information seeking; furthermore, a number of demographic and usage behavior differences exist between those who choose to engage in information-seeking behaviors on Facebook and those who do not. Finally, when predicting information-seeking behaviors, we identify a significant interaction between users’ perceptions of Facebook as appropriate for purposes beyond the purely social and their engagement with their network.","1.

These systems typically present force to a learner�s palm by directly actuating the tool. However, this approach is sometimes ineffective because learners have difficulty sensing the haptic feedback from the tool when they are holding it tightly. Thus, we propose a different approach (OCHD) that effectively guides the learner�s hand by presenting force to the back of his/her hand as if an instructor is holding it. A preliminary experiment showed that OCHD effectively guides users with less actuator drive force than cases where the tool is directly actuated.","1.

Based on the initial review comments as well as the post committee meeting comments, we made the following changes. \  \ Relevance to the HCI community: \ In the third paragraph of �DISCUSSION� section, we added how OCHD may be applied to other types of haptic interface i.e. wearable computers. In the second paragraph of �CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK� section, we added how OCHD might be embedded as part of a hand skill transfer equipment. We indicated two lines of OCHD usage: a master-slave control approach and an automatic guide approach.  \  \ Title: \ In order to clarify the main focus our paper - to propose a new haptic feedback method, we changed the title to �A Novel Haptic Feedback Method for Guiding Hand Motion with Lower Detection Threshold�. \  \ Details about the experimental methodology: \ Information about the subjects� dominant hand, the size of torque increment/decrement, and the number of reversals are added in the �Subjects and Procedures� section. \  \ Grasp force variation data: \ Grasp force variation data  is provided in the �Subjects and Procedures� section. \  \ Other changes: \ In order to clarify that the focus of our paper is to propose a new haptic device and to prove its capability to reduce the detection threshold, we revised the title, �ABSTRACT�, �INTRODUCTION�, �BACKGROUND�, and �CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK� sections. Also most of the expression �just noticeable� in this paper was replaced with �detection threshold�.  \  \ In order to provide more insight about how the subjects sensed the haptic feedback from the OCHD, we added the interview results at the end of the �RESULTS� section. In the last paragraph of �DISCUSSION� section, we also explained the remaining issues to refine the OCHD so that learners can sense 6-DOF.  \ ","","engineering, health","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 13:31",""

Yet much of this content becomes quickly lost in the stream shortly after being posted.  This paper looks at the feasibility of identifying useful content in microblog streams so that it might be archived to facilitate wider access and reference.  Towards this goal, we present an experiment with a game-with-a-purpose called  \ \\emph{Twiage} that we designed to determine how well the deluge of content in �raw� microblog streams could be turned into filtered and ranked collections using ratings from players.  Experiments with Twiage validate the feasibility of applying human-computation to this problem, finding strong agreement about what constitutes the ``most useful'' content in our test dataset. Second, we compare the effectiveness of various methods of eliciting such ratings, finding that a �choose-best� interface and Elo rating ranking scheme yield the greatest agreement in the fewest rounds.  External validation of resulting top-rated twitter content with a domain expert found that while the top Twiage-ranked �tweets� were among the best of the set, there was a tendency for players to also select what we term �weak spam� -- e.g., promotional content disguised as articles or reviews, indicating a need for more stringent content filtering.","1.

Problems arise when dealing with temporal ambiguities where a time span is projected onto a single point in image space, e.g., when objects stop moving. Existing DMVN systems deal with these cases by either disabling navigation on the paused object or by allowing jumps in the timeline. Both of these workarounds are undesirable as they introduce inconsistency or provoke loss of context. We analyze current practices regarding temporal ambiguities and introduce two new methods to visualize and navigate object pauses. User tests show that the new approaches are better suited for navigation in scenes containing temporal ambiguities and are rated higher in terms of user satisfaction.","1.

This NGO subsidizes health facilities by paying for medical services on the basis of claims submitted after the patient consultation, targeting treatment of 99,000 clients between 2006-2011. I successfully tested Claim Mobile in Summer 2008, processing 35 claims over two weeks, and then discontinued it six months later, when it became apparent that integration and scale-up of the technology would be problematic for the NGO. In addition, many issues we hoped to address through technology had been addressed through program management changes instead.  I find that a) the context motivating the technology changed over time, b) simpler solutions can be as effective as new technologies, and c) prioritizing the needs of the NGO required abandoning the deployment of Claim Mobile. Thus this paper presents the value of learning from failure in the process of designing for users in developing regions. \ ","1. Best, M.

Using a principal components analysis, we aggregated these variables into 13 components and found several correlations between them. The analysis especially showed the impact of seasons and a listener's interest in novelty on music choice.

However, the repetitive nature of these exercises; as well as the use of instructional booklets and videos for rehabilitation may discourage seniors to exercise in the home, thereby rendering such an intervention ineffective. Our work proposed that the use of multimodal games � co-designed with seniors � could be a way of making falls rehabilitation more enjoyable; thereby improving adherence to home exercise programmes. In this paper, we first explain the process by which we identified barriers to the users� effective interaction with current home rehabilitation tools. We then go on to describe how we actively involved seniors in the initial design, and improvement of useful, enjoyable games for falls rehabilitation.  Our findings suggest that seniors are an integral part of the design process and should be directly involved from the concept stages of the design of tools for their rehabilitation. ","1. Age UK.

","Stephen Uzor","stephen.uzor@gcu.ac.uk","We address the concerns of the reviewers in the following sections. \  \ We agree with reviewer 4 that we were missing references to Participatory Design (PD) research.  The Design Workshops were directly inspired by the work of PD researchers such as Susanne Bodker. We therefore add a section on this which had reference to amongst other Bodker and Buur�s (2002) work on the Design Collaboratorium and Chen�s(from the Helen Hamlyn Centre) work on Transitions: Communication Ageing and Independent Living. \  \ We also added some information requested by Reviewer 1 regarding practical issues when running workshops with older adults.   \  \ Reviewer 2 mentioned the use of personas and scenarios rather than talking to people about their own experiences.  This is in fact an important part of Phase 1 and we realised upon re-reading our paper that this is not completely clear. We therefore inserted this information into Table 1(Phase 1) and added a few lines to our text in the procedure section.  \  \ Reviewer 2 wonders why we did not involve older adults in the design of the prototype games used in the first workshop.  Although we do mention that these were basic games; upon reflection we realise that we should have made it clearer in the paper that these were not finished games, but rather very basic prototypes.  We have amended the paper to more clearly reflect this.  \  \ In the Background Section, we report on the successful use of technology and games for rehabilitation that had positive effects on motivation and amount of exercise performed. But we could clearly see Reviewers 2 and 4�s points regarding putting forward games as the only solution, we are in fact seeing games as only one potential enjoyable activity given the findings of previous research. We have amended the paper and have particularly amended our Future Work section so that it is clear that we intend to investigate the effectiveness of games in improving adherence to home exercise in a pilot RCT alongside other potentially useful tools such as visualisations of progress.  \  \ Reviewer 4 comments that the use of video games for rehabilitation may fall prone to the same criticism as the booklet and videos with regards to maintaining prolonged interest. One of the most important motivators to exercise, as stated by our participants, was the ability to view progress during rehabilitation. Reviewer 1 also points out the importance of progress and this was something that was discussed during the workshops. Some interesting ideas came out of this and we have included these ideas in the final draft of the paper.  \  \ Reviewer 2 asks if the participants could reject the concept of games and we would like to reassure them that the participants could reject games. The paper has been amended to reflect this. For example, during the discussion in Phase 1 any ideas for improvements to current experience could be made. Also, in Phase 3 (User Sketches) the participants could design anything they liked e.g. games or alternative enjoyable activities they would like to see designed.  \  \ We also clarified the type of contribution and what category of user research findings we thought that the paper contributed to. We would like to thank the AC in this regard as we think this clarification of our work overall was very useful in framing the work correctly.  \  \ ","","user experience","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 09:07",""

However, the current literature often focuses on best practice design strategies and frameworks. Fine-grained details, contextual descriptions, and organisational factors that are invaluable in helping us to learn from and reflect on project experiences are often overlooked. In this paper, we present five distinct and sometimes competing perspectives that are critical in understanding factors that influence serious game projects: project organisation, technology, domain knowledge, user research, and game design. We explain these perspectives by providing insights from the design and development process of an EU-funded serious game about conflict resolution developed by an interdisciplinary consortium of researchers and industry-based developers. We also point out a set of underlying forces that become evident from viewing the process from different perspectives, to underscore that problems exist in serious game projects and that we should open the conversation about them. \ ","1.

We revised the sections on ""Project Organisation"" and ""Technology"" (as these were the ones deemed too general) by shortening them and including deeper connections to the serious games literature. The Project Organisation section now includes a paragraph on project organisation literature in serious games and organisation science (p3, para 4), and the section now ties our  observations directly back to implications for serious game project  processes. Likewise, the Technology section features a paragraph in which we discuss other literature examining the role of technology with regards to games and serious games (p4, para 3), and connect our work to this literature throughout the paper.  \  \ In addition, throughout, we have connected our findings to those from other serious games projects. This was a suggestion from one of the reviewers, and we feel that these new connections should address reviewers' concerns about whether this paper focuses enough on serious games. \  \ 2) We were asked to explain how our observations have been influencing our project. In the section on ""Underlying Forces"", the discussion of each force is now ended with how we are counter-balancing its effects.","","design, games","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 24 00:31",""

As outlined above we have followed the advice of AC1 in attempting to distinguish more clearly our work from Zimmerman�s, and highlight what we see as our paper�s contribution since lack of a clear contribution forms the substance of AC2�s critique.

The main purpose of this figure is to give a sense of the sorts of contents that are found in a record folder to aid comprehension of discussion of its composition and use. We believe the improved figure serves this purpose.

Thus in safety-critical environments, it is often considered safer to perform tasks sequentially. Here we explore how the cost of accessing information affects the way people choose to interleave. An empirical study based on a medical scenario was conducted. Participants had to program infusion pump devices using information from a prescription form. The physical and mental effort involved in accessing information was manipulated. This was achieved by varying the physical distance between the prescription form and the devices. We demonstrate that by increasing information access cost, individuals are less likely to omit a required task step. This is because they adopt a more memory-intensive strategy, which encourages interleaving at natural boundaries, i.e., after completing the programming of one of the pumps. Interleaving during programming can result in task steps being forgotten.","1. Altmann, E.M. and Trafton, J.G. Memory for goals: An activation-based model. Cognitive Science 26, (2002), 39-83. \ 2.

We hope that we have now provided sufficient detail that explains how our IAC manipulation resulted in this behaviour (see rebuttal for more details).  \  \ -	(Introduction section) - Clearer description stating that the manipulation of IAC influenced how much information participants read from the prescription form during each glance to it. Moreover, interleaving when adopting a perceptual-motor strategy is driven by prompts from the devices. \ -	(Materials section) - Description and figure added that shows how information on the prescription form was presented to participants, making it clear what values could be meaningfully chunked. This is important since when one chooses to read pairs of values to hold in memory then it should be by infusion (i.e., VTBI1 & Time1), which was best served by programming one device at a time.  \ -	(Procedure section) - Aspects of training that encouraged interleaving-by-pump added. \ -	(Results section) Added eye tracking analysis which shows that in the Low-IAC condition participants were reading a single value at a time. This resulted in more interleaving-by-pump in the Low-IAC condition, and thus continued the pattern of interleaving-by-pump established during initialisation steps. \ -	(Discussion section) Added explanation that interleaving programming behavior is reinforced by prompts from the devices: at the start of programming both pumps are requesting VTBI values be entered. \  \ At the request of our 1stAC1 we have also added a reference to Duggan and Payne (2001), which is included in the discussion section.  \  \ Our 2ndAC would like practical implications to be discussed. Thus, we have added a paragraph to the end of the paper that discusses implications for medical device design more explicitly. \  \ The revision of our paper has also addressed all the other issues raised by our three reviewers that mainly relate to clarity and detail. The section on omission errors was revised and is now more concise. The coffee example was dropped to free up space.  The method section has been revised to describe the experimental task environment in detail, facilitated by replacing a redundant figure with a table that outlines required actions. Clearer details relating the experimental design, and details of eye tracker model used have been added. Clarification of how participants were rewarded to incentivize careful performance has been provided.  \  \ We hope that you are happy with our efforts to revise our paper. We greatly look forward to talking about this work at CHI. Finally, many thanks for the work that was undertaken when reviewing and discussing this paper.","","design, engineering, health","ContentComplete","FormatComplete","","Best","Sep 23 10:52","??"

We have proposed apparatuses to add electric taste to food and drink. An interactive system could be developed to synchronize video contents using the reversibility and instantaneity of electric taste. However, to do so, the presentation time must be determined based on the different latency for the perception of each sense. We measured the latencies for electric taste and visual stimuli as a basic evaluation for a content presentation system in which electric taste and visual content are synchronized.","1.

Yet, the progress made and the key research questions for shape-changing interfaces are rarely analyzed systematically. We review a sample of existing work on shape-changing interfaces to address these shortcomings. We identify eight types of shape that are transformed in various ways to serve both functional and hedonic design purposes. Interaction with shape-changing interfaces is simple and rarely merges input and output. Three questions are discussed based on the review: (a) which design purposes may shape-changing interfaces be used for, (b) which parts of the design space are not well understood, and (c) why studying user experience with shape-changing interfaces is important.","1.

Our experiences with the approach highlighted areas where designers and participants held radically different views. The tenet of our approach was that to overcome these differences we needed to create an empathic relationship between participants and designers. To achieve this we modified participatory design techniques to foster respectful engagement with participants in the development of a digital aid to facilitate �safe walking‟. The process begins with broad qualitative scoping and design work then moves to developing personally tailored, individual designs to further exploration of the experiential elements of the domain while reducing the need for the participants to engage in abstract thought. Reflection highlights a number of important areas that demand consideration when undertaking research in this area and, more generally, when performing design work with people with dementia.","1.

","Stephen Lindsay","stephen.lindsay@ncl.ac.uk","The reviewers have asked for several changes prior to this paper being accepted, we list the changes below and the places in the final version of the paper where those changes can be found: \  \ 1. R1 suggests some additional references \  \ Although we were not aware of Kontos and Shinohara�s work, and we thank the reviewer for pointing it out to us, we were aware of notions such as personhood, agency and citizenship being increasingly applied in dementia research as a way in which people with dementia can be empowered. (Narrative, citizenship and dementia: The personal and the political Baldwin 2008 and Ethnographic reflections on selfhood, embodiment and Alzheimer's disease, Kontos 2004).  We agree that this strengthens our argument for undertaking PD with people with dementia; this can be made clearer within our reflections on Concerns about stigma associated with devices (p.8). \  \ 2. (They ask that the)... contribution of the paper and take-home message be articulated a little more explicitly.  \  \ We acknowledge that we don�t foreground this issue as much as we might in the body of the work. This is tied to R1�s suggestion of making clearer signposts throughout our paper, and we therefore feel that this suggestion would help us outline our paper�s contribution to this field more clearly (p.1).  We have also proof read and amended the paper for clarity of contribution throughout with better signposting. \  \ 3. the framing with respect to PD vs. user-informed design,  \  \ R2�s concern about the process of UID vs PD is interesting and also important for us to address. They are correct in pointing out that the process has strong elements of information gathering as opposed to being truly PD at times. However, it was important to us that we kept the space for design contributions open as a key part of the process of showing respect towards our participants (note we don�t mean to imply this could not be achieved with UID). As we documented when recounting our experiences, the more animated debates over design points in the Tailored Design section led to some of the most interesting insights into the design domain and we feel this contributes to justifying terming our approach PD. We clarify and emphasise this point in THE KITE PROJECT�S APPROACH TO DESIGN (p.2) and in the reflections on Inadvertently Disempowering People with Dementia (p.8). \  \ 4. the significance of the personal prototypes (which is an interesting strategy, but raises questions with regard to generalisability) \  \ R2 notes that, while very interesting, the generalizability of the tailored design process needs to be considered. The process involved in building these designs was very much the focus of our method and we could have given more consideration to their generalizability in this paper. To compensate for this we shorten the discussion of storyboards, paper prototypes and functional prototypes into a single paragraph in the Personally Tailored Design section on p.5 and use the saved space to add a small discussion the wider implications of opting to follow the tailored design tradition, and drawing in a sample of the relevant literature on the matter such as [10] \  \ 5. Some reflection on the process after the case study, particularly with respect to empathy, would be helpful - what aspects of the process actually contribute to this? \  \ The Reflections section (p.9) has been edited to include reflections on this issue. \  \ 6. R3 would like to better understand why we feel this method differs from �normal� or traditional Participatory Design (PD). We have left the differences implicit in the text (pacing issues for memory, review in meeting, respectful engagement and an emphasis on the relationship between designer and participant) but as suggested, we make this clearer throughout our argument.   We therefore highlight these differences as we introduce them (e.g. �Unlike many PD approaches....�), to make them explicit while not over-reaching on claims of novelty. \ ","","design, health","","FormatComplete","","Best","Sep 23 15:54","1"

The study illustrates that materiality and digitality are complementary, instead of one substituting the other, and are highly intertwined in the hybrid media environment around which meaningful experiences are conditioned and produced. It also suggests that an analytic distinction between materiality and digitality is fruitful in unpacking the complex relations between media technologies and social experiences.","1. Appadurai, A.

Below we summarize our changes in accordance to  the meta-reivew and other suggestions. \  \  \ 1) Reviewer 1 has some minor observation regarding modification on a sentence, but this is complemented by other  observations by Reviewer 2which suggest other changes and reviewing the grammar by a native english speaker. \  \ - A native speaker helped to review the paper before the final submission \  \ 2) R2 points to a contradiction that authors should check and correct \    (page 8). \  \ - We clarified this by the following changes: we removed the analogy between remote co-watching and movie theater going;  we used a separate  paragraph to highlight the limitation and challenge of remote co-watching with new media TV, although social media provide certain potential. \  \    3) Some findings can be discussed in more detail and in general the  Discussion Section should be checked to avoid just restating  the findings instead of discussing them. \  \ - We removed the paragraph of restating our findings,  and also removed lengthy descriptions of other not so directly related work such as Brown and Duguid's, as well as  Sellen and Harper's. We then used the space to engage discussions of how our findings are connected and also distinct from findings of hybrid media and computerized TV. \  \  \ Besides, we also improved the paper in the following aspects in response to some individual reviewers' suggestions: \ 1.Primary reviewer: Firstly authors could provide more details on the way they precede when analyzing the data collected. Very little information is included to understand the research methodology in terms of analysis.  \  \ - We used a separate paragraph to elaborate more on the research methodology and provide more details on how the data is analyzed.  \  \ 2.Primary reviewer: Related to that is the perception that some observations made by authors seem to be particular to an individual participant; one would suggest to identify common patterns rather than focusing on particular cases. Finally, it would be important to provide a unifying model (better a grounded theory) to summarize the findings. This would be important to move the paper from being a collection of good observations framed within a set of themes, into providing a model from which others can continue the work in this area. \  \ - We clarified at the end of the methodology section, that representative individual quotes were used to illustrate some common points.  \ -  We reorganized and represented the findings, and also made the section titles more specific as a way to better serve the central theme of the paper, which is using an analytic distinction between materiality and digitally to explicate phenomena around TV watching. \ - We also added a paragraph on second page to highlight how our work is related and different from previous work on hybrid media to emphasize our contribution in this paper. \  \ 3.Reviwer 2: Related to the above: the paper states that there are no online services that allow people to chat in real time while watching a show. Is this true everywhere, or just China?) \  On page 7, the discussion about online commenting felt a bit thin. People have been able to discuss TV shows online for years -- even if they watched the show on old TV. Is the nature of communication different when people are watching the show online? For example, is the commenting more real-time, and therefore more satisfactory? Clarification here would be appreciated. \  \ - We clarified this by using a separate section to discuss the use of social media in TV watching. In this section, we didn't distinguish between new media and traditional TV, as social media have been employed for both, and pointed out the opportunities and challenges of using social media to support remote co-watching experiences in the new media environments.  \  \ 4. reviewer2: I enjoyed the discussion of ""deep watching"", but it seemed limited. \  \ - I added more data to elaborate this finding more. \  \ ","","user experience","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 19:22","2"

Additionally, please attend carefully to the second ACs review as they make key suggestions for revisions. \ The changes to the document are included point by point along with the responses made (drawn from the rebuttal as appropriate) with specific references to the location where a change can be found for the reviewers� convenience: \  \ 1. Suggested References \  \ The references that have been suggested to us have been included in this new document. In general, they are distributed throughout the document where they can be used to further support the claims already in the document; for example, when discussing the motivations and challenges around engaging older adults in PD on p.3. \  \ 2. It is clear OASIS is a variant of PD with elders, and consequently the differences should be clarified. \  \ The contribution statement at the end of the Introduction on p.1 has been altered to make this point clearer and we have also altered the introduction to the method (The OASIS Approach) on p.3 to reinforce this. \  \ 3. The literature on video vignettes in design needs to be cited and engaged with as well. \  \ The technique is quite flexible and the examples given are verbose so we will scale these back to make room for this discussion. This scaling back will also allow us to give a clearer take-home message to readers hopefully addressing reviewers concerns. This can be found in the Creating Video Prompts section on p.5 \  \ 4. If one reframes the contribution of this paper not as a new method, but as a case study.  The richness of the data and key design challenges working with this population become apparent.    \  \ The final paragraph of the introduction is altered on p.1 to use the term case study to make this clear. \  \ 5. What was your rationale for using TV characters for the security scenario?  \  \ This is clarified in the Practical Experiences Using Videos section on p.6. \  \ 6. Minor issue: One final caution just as not all issues apply to all elders (and occasionally you fall into generalities), similarly not all disabled individuals are elderly.  There are young individuals who may share the cognitive and physical impairments of the aged, but they have problems that are unique to that demographic. \  \ Generalisations in the paper will be addressed in two ways: 1) we will alter the language as reviewers suggest and 2) where these generalisations are being made based upon our experiences we will make this explicit. No specific page given as this is a general edit/ re-examination of the language \  \ 7. The acronym OASIS also needs definition.  \   \ The OASIS name that the reviewers question is taken from the project this work was conducted under, we can cite this specific project but we didn�t in this version because it removes any anonymity from the process (There are over 200 research projects named OASIS so the name itself doesn�t give too much away!)  The project did not explicitly address participatory design so its acronym is not very relevant but our role in it was to provide guidance for partners in engaging with elderly participants hence the name is taken from the project. This is made this clear in the OASIS Approach section on p.3 \  \ 8. In our rebuttal we stated: ""R3 seems to doubt our account of the reluctance amongst some to engage older people in design but R4 provides some interesting evidence of heir own on CHI�s paper acceptance rate with regard to older people. Beyond this, we feel the paper might underplay it�s hand with respect to how engaged we were with these partners (we worked closely with them on issues beyond the design) and so we are very confident in our assessment of their reluctance and it�s reasons and we have discussed these issues candidly with them. This can easily be made clearer in the relevant section.""  \  \ This can now be found in the Motivating Engagement with Older Adults section on p.9 \  \ 9. In our rebuttal we stated: ""Some reviewers raised specific issues about the clarity of methods and these will all be addressed in the camera ready version."" \  \ The methods sections on p.4-8 have been changed to reflect this. \ ","","design","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 19:55",""

Based on our findings, we discuss tensions between playfulness and utility, in particular relating to socio-economic benefits, and conclude that playfulness in these settings needs to be taken as seriously as in any other setting. Additionally, we formulated three challenges when designing for play in similar settings: (1) engage intimately with the materials of inexpensive ICT; (2) revisit design recommendations for playfulness to ensure that they can travel/translate into other cultures; and (3) alleviate existing tensions.","1.

Though the part on ""information play"" was kept, but slightly changed so as to tone down some of the extrapolations and judgement of value initially present, in accordance to the reviewers' observations and our own thoughts. Other parts (such as ""Summary"" were more shortened). Most of the space, though was made by removing, what we felt were redundant sentences here and there. This was more arduous work, but allowed us to keep most of what we felt was more meaningful text.  \ - We tried to be more explicit in acknowledging the non-exotic nature of some of the behaviors to account for the ""imperial tone"" that we got as comment, and connect them with behaviors we are also familiar with within our cultures. Colleagues also read our text and helped us correct some other parts which may have also had an imperial tone to them. \ - We tried to motivate better what we meant with playful behaviors so that the playfulness illustrated in the results would be more apparent. \ - Mentioning of the work in HCI we proposed to add in the rebuttal, to better acknowledge for more similar, previous work, to avoid creating a sense of ""false antagonism"". \ - More information was added on the setting, setup and methodology, though as mentioned in the rebuttal we tried to keep it as short as possible so as to allow for more additions on the background side and avoid removing data and analysis.  \ - We are glad that these additions (as well as in the background on playfulness) could be accommodated without removing much of the works' core content and contribution. This was mostly achieved through a very extensive review of the text and trying to synthesize some aspects, removing sentences and paragraphs which added little to the data and discussion, thus making the text perhaps a bit more dense, though not in a negative way, in our perspective. \ - Given the typos and some shortcomings with the English language, we paid a professional proofreader to help us with our text. We were very pleased with his work though this actually resulted in quite a bit of changes. The structure of the paper remained the same, but most paragraphs suffered stylistic changes, thus perhaps making the reviewers unfamiliar at first with the text. Most of the changes though were in terms of order of propositions and adding/removing some terms, allowing for a better flow and readability. \ - Again we would like to thank the reviewers for their comments and taking their time to verify this submission, yet another time.","","design","","FormatComplete","","Honorable Mention","Sep 23 18:23",""

For this reason, digital pens are now embedded with auxiliary input sensors to capture these actions. Prior research on auxiliary input channels has mainly investigated them in isolation of one another. In this work, we explore the coordinated use of two auxiliary channels, a class of interaction techniques we refer to as a-coord input. Through two separate experiments, we explore the design space of a-coord input. In the first study we identify if users can successfully coordinate two auxiliary channels. We found a strong degree of coordination between channels. In a second experiment, we evaluate the effectiveness of a-coord input in a task with multiple steps, such as multi-parameter selection and manipulation. We find that a-coord input facilitates coordination even with a complex, aforethought sequential task. Overall our results indicate that users can control at least two auxiliary input channels in conjunction which can facilitate a number of common tasks can on the pen. ","1.

A clear understanding of children�s headache characteristics is crucial for delivering appropriate treatment. However, current data collection methods were designed for adults often resulting in insufficient information. In this paper we present a novel method to help children communicate with health care providers and researchers about their headaches. It augments an existing child-centric method called Draw-and-Tell Conversation, which has already been shown to provide more actionable information from children than standard data collection methods.  It does so by enabling children to draw their symptoms on a zoomable drawing application, giving them the ability to provide more details and context than on paper. We present a study conducted with nineteen children aged 7 to 12 suggesting that children provided more information about their headaches when using the zoomable drawing application than when drawing on paper. This study provides a rare example of a mobile device used to enhance face-to-face interactions and contributes evidence of a specific benefit of zoomable user interfaces.","1.

CTE1.2 improves upon previous models of information foraging by adding a model of hierarchical visual search to guide foraging behavior. Built within CogTool so it is easy to represent UI layouts, run the model, and present results, CTE1.2's vision is to assess many design ideas at the storyboard stage before implementation and without the cost of running human participants. This paper evaluates CTE1.2 predictions against observed human behavior on 108 tasks (36 tasks on 3 distinct website layouts). CTE1.2's predictions accounted for 63-82% of the variance in the percentage of participants succeeding on each task, the number of clicks to success, and the percentage of participants succeeding without error. We demonstrate how these predictions can be used to identify areas of the UI in need of redesign.","1. Anderson, J. R., Bothell, D., Byrne, M. D., Douglass, S., Lebiere, C., and Qin, Y.

Attached is our revised CHI paper, where we have made changes to address all the points in your email. Below is the list of points you sent us and we summarize the changes we have made to most of these points in yellow. Point 14 is highlighted in blue, because we have already discussed this via email and you agreed to drop it as a condition. You will see that we have not been able to respond to Point 13 (also highlighted in blue) � we tried hard, but the science just isn�t ready to speculate any further than we had already done in the original submission. We hope this is OK. \  \ In addition to the points you listed, we also fixed a few little things that the reviewers caught (e.g., R3 noticed that Eq1 really wasn�t a �running average� so we fixed that prose). \  \ Please let us know if you are happy with these changes or whether we have to do any more work before submitting the camera-ready on Jan 13. \  \ Thanks,  \ Leonghwee, Bonnie & Marilyn. \  \ 1.	Make the following 3 contributions clear (as stated in the rebuttal):  \ o	CTE1.2 introduces hierarchical visual search to the process of information foraging, so the model decides which group of links in the UI to focus on before attending to any link within a group. \ We have rewritten the abstract to clearly state that CTE1.2 improves on previous models by the addition of hierarchical visual search. This point also been reprised in several locations in the rest of the paper (e.g., Implementation details, Results).  \ o	Hierarchical visual search allows CTE1.2 to predict performance on the multi-group layout (93 links in 9 groups) far better than CTE1.1, which used flat visual search. \ This is now made clear in the results table, Table 1, and elsewhere in the prose. \ o	CTE1.2 is the first process model of information foraging that has been applied to different layouts without peeking at any human data to set parameters (avoids ""overfitting"" of model to data, maximizing model's ability to generalize). \ This is now in the paragraph just above Figure 5 and reiterated in the Conclusions.   \  \ 2.	Change the phrase �CTE1.2 with knowledge of groups turned off� to �CTE 1.1."" Also, clarify or remove discussion about turning groups on and off if not necessary. \ Done. The �Results� section has been rewritten so it only refers to CTE1.1 and CTE1.2 (it no longer mentions turning groups off and on). \  \ 3.	Expand Table 1 to include CTE1.1 results so readers can easily see that CTE1.2 increased R-squared on the Multi-Group layout by a factor of 1.5 to 2.3 on the various metrics.  \ Done. Table 1 now shows results from both CTE1.1 and CTE1.2. \  \  \ 4.	Remove the evolution of Eq3 to Eq4 and point interested readers to [24,25] for details.  \ Done. The �Serial Evaluation� section has been rewritten after Eq. 2. \  \ 5.	Give more detail on the experiment, examples of hard and easy tasks, and be more explicit about how the data was used.  \ We have rewritten the description of the experiment in the section entitled EVALUATION OF COGTOOL-EXPLORER 1.2, including more detail, examples of hard and easy tasks, and more about how we used our log files. \  \ 6.	Improve your discussion of the role of time as discussed in your rebuttal, ""All the metrics inherently include time because the tasks had a 130s deadline for both humans and model. If the model worked faster than humans, it could click on everything, if it worked slower than humans it wouldn�t explore as much as they did; neither would predict well. We can explain why time parameters are important and include values as R3 requests."" \ We added several sentences to the beginning of the �Time to Access Information Scent� section. We added the times for EMMA�s eye movements and perception operators (in the �ACT-R Eyes� section) and ACT-R�s implementation of Fitts�s Law (in the �ACT-R Hands� section). \  \ 7.	Expand discussion of CTE1.2's stochasticity (from rebuttal: ""CTE1.2 is stochastic in its selection of which link to look at next and in its judgment of information scent...We will fix the implementation details and also elevate stochasticity into the overview."")  \ We added a sentence in the �Representation of Semantic Knowledge� section and a sentence in �Overview of CTE1.2� section.  \  \ 8.	Claiming success: Please justify how you judged the success of CTE1.2  \ Instead of explaining �success�, we removed the claim to success in the first sentence of the �Discussion� section (as we suggested doing in our rebuttal). This will let the reader decide how they feel about what we present, instead of claiming �success�. \  \ 9.	Fix the following as described in your rebuttal: ""The submitted paper had a line missing; the definition of RsqClicksToSuccess should read 'Correlation between model and participants on the number of clicks on links to accomplish each task.'"" \ Fixed. \  \ 10.	Explain what the results mean more clearly, e.g., how they are comparable to other modeling papers (e.g., ""[5] where R-squared=0.56 for ClicksToSuccess, attained by fitting parameters to human data""). \ We added a paragraph (below Table 1 and above Figure 5) comparing CTE1.2 to DOI-ACT and SNIF-ACT. \  \ 11.	Do the following reorganization: present the improved Table 1 (as discussed in #3 above), then present and discuss Figure 5, explicitly addressing the issue of slope and intercept, and finally explain how Table 2 illustrates a possible use of CTE1.2.  \ Figure 5 is now presented in the �Results� section and the �Discussion� section has been reworded to refer back to it when explaining how to use CTE1.2�s predictions. \  \ 12.	Reorder the rows and re-color Table 2 as R1 suggests. \ Done. Table 2 is now ordered from easiest to hardest task (for the humans) and colored so that it prints well in black and white. \  \ 13.	Reflect upon why CTE1.2 underestimates low success rates. \ We now speculate, on the top right of page 9, that other types of reasoning beyond information foraging, is used, especially when information foraging fails as in the hard tasks. We suggest a couple of other mechanisms in addition to infoscent that might be added to the model in the future to make its predictions better. \  \ 14.	Explain further what you mean by the model being built in ACT-R (see R1 comments).  \ Andrea, thank you for agreeing with us that this would be a distraction in this CHI paper and that interested readers can get the details in other papers we have referenced.  \  \ 15.	Include more discussion of previous work on hierarchical visual search and how your work on CTE1.2 relates to it (see R3's updated review). R3: Given the stated contributions in the rebuttal, I'd recommend a more inclusive coverage of previous work on hierarchical layouts. While the work of Kitajima et al. and Miller and Remington are already noted, the authors may want to consider Hornof's work (in HCI, 2004), which employs a similar process, albeit with labels that are evaluated with an exact match rather than semantic similarity.  In any case, a more detailed review and comparison to CTE 1.2 would clarify the contribution and aid reviewers in assessing its significance. \ We had already referenced Halverson and Hornof�s Minimal Model of Visual Search (2007), which built on the empirical results in Hornof (2004), because we adapted their model for CTE1.2. However, to make the reader more aware of the connection, we now reference Hornof (2004) in the Overview Section when we say that others have argued for a hierarchical search and we have added an additional sentence in the Implementation section about Visual Search comparing and contrasting CTE1.2�s mechanism to both Hornof (2004) and Halveson & Hornof (2007). \  \  \ ","","engineering","ContentComplete","FormatComplete","","","Sep 24 00:01",""

The focus of the workshops was new banking technologies for the older old. Participants were asked to discuss their current experiences of banking and given packs of concept cards which contained design sketches and brief outlines of concepts for new financial services. The designs on the cards were deliberately provocative and aimed to encourage criticism and debate. Participants wrote and drew on the cards and the workshops were recorded and transcribed. The participants were extremely critical of current banking practices and most of the new concepts we presented to them. Their questions and comments led to a number of insights and further iterations. The paper argues that critique is an essential resource for design, both in terms of identifying problems and iterating ideas.","1.	Bardzell, J and Bardzell, S.

We have only referred to Vines et al. 2011 (Eighty Something) and Vines et al. 2012 (Cheque Mates) here as they seems most relevant to this context. We have also referred to other past work later Vines et al. 2012 (Joy of Cheques) but this is not directly related to the work described in this paper. \  \ --A short paragraph (third) in the DISCUSSION has been added distinguishing the Questionable Concepts approach to other more recent PD workshop techniques.  \  \ --The METHOD section has been extended to explain more clearly the two sets of participants, explaining what influenced us to recruits a new set of participants (para 1) and why this could be seen as a strength of the research (paragraph 2).  \  \ --We have stressed that new ideas were developed for the new participants as (this was already in the original submission � in paragraph 5 of QUESTIONABLE CONCEPT CARDS and paragraph 3 of METHOD). \  \ --The first paragraph of METHOD has been adjusted to clarify the issue of gender bias in our participants. \  \ --We had already touched on the Digital Cheques in the DISCUSSION but have extended this briefly to explain how the cards fed into this work, even though they mostly fed into it through the �questioning� of the other concepts. We have also tightened up the last sections to be more concise. \  \ --We have altered the QUESTIONABLE CONCEPT CARDS section quite significantly to clarify some of the concerns about how �questionability� was arrived at. We have explained that we used all of the ideas from the �ideation/brainstorming� workshop although some were discarded and combined as they were similar to one another. We have tried to emphasise that we wanted the ideas to be questionable in order to provoke discussion (this was in the original submission but is now expanded a little) but that there were aspects that the participants found �questionable� which we did not intend to be from the outset.  \  \ --We have clarified in the CRITIQUE AS A RESOURCE FOR DESIGN section that hostility and disdain were not necessary. \  \ --We have tightened up the critique as a resource section and emphasised how the derision of some ideas still informed the design process � hence the criticisms (such as those of the Pin Thimble) still lead to useful design insights.  \  \ --A sentence has been added to the DISCUSSION on the use of �good� graphic design.  \  \ --We have altered the subtitles of the three categories so they are less ambiguous and link the themes up in a more logical fashion. The results section (was previously a separate �analysis� section) has also had the long paras broken up and participants quotes that are longer than four lines into separate paragraphs and indented these as requested. \  \ --The title has been altered as requested. \  \ --We have attended to all of the noted typos, and also had the final document proof read several times.

The study provides insights relevant for the organizational context since it is based on a system implemented within IBM.  We developed a detailed codebook and used it to categorize 9,506 tags assigned to a sample of taggers. Our analysis examines the use of self tags versus social tags (assigned by others) across different categories and sub-categories. While overlap exists, self tags tend to be more factual describing technology expertise, social tags augment the individual tags by adding a personal dimension.","1. Back, M. D., Stopfer, J.

With the proliferation of mobile devices capable of supporting significantly complex applications on small screens, demands on mobile UI design and the user�s visual system are becoming greater. In this paper, we report results from an empirical study of human visual attention, specifically the Change Blindness phenomenon, on handheld mobile devices and its impact on mobile UI design. It is arguable that due to the small size of the screen - unlike a typical computer monitor - a greater visual coverage of the mobile device is possible, and that these phenomena may occur less frequently during the use of the device, or even that they may not occur at all. Our study shows otherwise. \  \ We tested for Change Blindness (CB) and Inattentional Blindness (IB) in a single-modal, mobile context and attempted to establish factors in the application interface design that induce and/or reduce their occurrences. The results show that both CB and IB can and do occur while using mobile devices. The results also suggest that the number of separate attendable items on-screen is directly proportional to rates of CB. Newly inserted objects were correctly identified more often than changes applied to existing on-screen objects. These results suggest that it is important for mobile UI designers to take these aspects of visual attention into account when designing mobile applications that attempt to deliver information through visual changes or notifications.","1.

However, experimental evidence is sparse, in part because of difficulties inducing communication online. Moreover, previous work has not identified the route by which communication leads to increased commitment. In this paper, we investigated whether task versus social communication modeled by a leader versus a peer influenced the amount that group members talked and their willingness to continue participating in the group. We conducted an experiment within ad hoc groups in the online game World of Warcraft. Results suggest that communication early in a group�s history causes members to talk more later on and that the early communication increases their commitment through its influence on group atmosphere rather than through increased member participation. Social communication by a peer is especially valuable in increasing commitment.","1. Allen, N. J., and Meyer, J. P.

We seek to bring physical interaction to digital modeling, to allow users to use existing physical objects as tangible building blocks for new designs. We introduce KidCAD a digital clay interface for children to remix toys. KidCAD allows children to imprint 2.5D shapes from physical objects into their digital models by deforming a malleable gel input device, deForm. Users can mashup existing objects, edit and sculpt or draw new designs on a 2.5D canvas using physical objects, hands and tools as well as 2D touch gestures. We report on a preliminary user study with 13 children, ages 7 to 10, which provides feedback for our design and helps guide future work in tangible modeling for children.  ","1.

Also how these motivations framed our user study. This can be found on page 4, and in context of the user study on page 6. \  \ We described comparisons between our initial clay explorations and our user study with KidCAD. This can be found on page 8. We also tried to better highlight the original clay explorations by changing one of the images depicting it, to give readers a better idea of a base line. \  \ We tried to better describe the limitations of the KidCAD system in the new Limitations and Future work section. We also propose in that section the use of an external depth sensing camera like the kinect, to facilitate interaction with larger objects or clay. This was suggested by reviewer 2. In this section we also tried to address that most physical objects were never designed to be remixed, and how this can point toward future work, as suggested by AC1. \  \ We changed the story telling section as AC2 suggested. Removing the claim of ""a trend of storytelling"" and instead described how users used KidCAD as a tool for story telling. \  \ We cited the paper explaining epistemic action, as well as other papers suggested by the reviewers.  \  \ We revised the document and fixed typos.","","design, children","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 19:02",""

This paper explores how corporate career presences on network sites should be realized in order to attract potential applicants. Therefore, we tested the impact of seven individual characteristics (namely Appointments, Daily Working Routine, Jobs, Corporate News, Entertainment, Media Format, and Features) of these corporate career presences that we extracted by a comprehensive pre-study on users' perceived hedonic and utilitarian value of these presences on social network sites. Based on an online survey with 470 participants, the results reveal a highly significant impact of five characteristics that corporate career presences provide both a hedonic as well as a utilitarian value to the user.","1.

Unsurprisingly then, the importance of food to our lives has long been recognized in the social sciences, and more recently, in Human-Computer Interaction. Yet, despite ongoing trends towards the digital augmentation of domestic environments, little consideration has been given to the impact of the material aspects of food consumption in the home. This paper takes an ecological approach to uncovering the role spaces, tabletops, and artefacts play in the social organization of domestic eating practices. Based on our findings of interviews with seven households in England, we discuss implications for those seeking to digitally augment domestic dining.","1. Aberg, J.

Many older people find cheques valuable as a means of payment but the UK Payments Council recently proposed their abolition. We describe two designs that simultaneously aimed to preserve and augment the paper cheque as a means of making electronic payments. These were devised during participatory design workshops through critical dialogues with our eighty something participants. Workshop discussions resulted in the creation of a real world cheque system where we issued pre-paid cheques without the involvement of banks. This work informed the development of a digital cheque book based on Anoto digital pen technology.

Horn","michael-horn@northwestern.edu","In this paper we describe visitor interaction with an interactive tabletop exhibit on evolution that we designed for use in natural history museums. We video recorded 30 families using the exhibit at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. We also observed an additional 50 social groups interacting with the exhibit without video recording. The goal of this research is to explore ways to develop ""successful"" interactive tabletop exhibits for museums. To determine criteria for success in this context, we borrow the concept of Active Prolonged Engagement (APE) from the science museum literature. Research on APE sets a high standard for visitor engagement and learning, and it offers a number of useful concepts and measures for research on interactive surfaces in the wild. In this paper we adapt and expand on these measures and apply them to our tabletop exhibit. Our results show that visitor groups collaborated effectively and engaged in focused, on-topic discussion for prolonged periods of time. To understand these results, we analyze visitor conversation at the exhibit. Our analysis suggests that social practices of game play contributed substantially to visitor collaboration and engagement with the exhibit.","1. Allen, S. and Gutwill, J.P.

Four distinct layers of compliance are identified, as are three different kinds of accountability, all of which stand potentially at odds with one another. The paper examines the tensions created by this, tensions that are further aggravated by instructions usually being delivered down a thin channel, with considerable surrounding contextual complexity and little opportunity for repair, and uncovers some core challenges for future design in relation to providing instructions for, and orchestrating a range of possible activities.","1.

A reference to Hoshi�s �Noncontact Tactile Display Based on Radiation Pressure of Airborne Ultrasound.� was added in the section entitled Generating Sufficient Force to Move Objects (page 2, paragraph 3). This paper explains in detail how the focal points are generated. \  \ 2.	We removed the second half of the final paragraph in the Arrangement of Ultrasound Transducers section (page 2, paragraph 7). This touched on the issue of the lip around the display, which is also covered in the Discussion section. It is therefore duplicate content and was removed to make space for more details on the implementation. \  \ 3.	The �Moving a Tangible Object� and �Moving Multiple Objects� sections have been consolidated into one section entitled �Moving Tangible Objects� (page 2). As suggested, this section focuses solely on moving multiple objects, as if several objects can be moved simultaneously, it is easy to infer that a single object could be moved. Most of the original �Moving a Tangible Object� section was deleted and some of the remaining text was rephrased to make sense as a result. This change made most of the space for the extra details provided in the implementation section. \  \ 4.	The Implementation section (pages 2&3) has been restructured into three distinct segments of the system to provide a clearer explanation of how it works: \  \ 4.1.	The Ultrasound Transmitter Array section (page 2, paragraph 15) explains the arrangement of the ultrasonic transducers. \  \ 4.2.	The Pulse Generation section (page 2, paragraph 16) details the circuitry that drives the transducers. This is where most of the extra detail has been added. We have also specifically named all the principle components that were used. \  \ 4.3.	Finally the Control Loop section (page 3, paragraph 3) has been slightly rephrased to give a clearer explanation of how the PC calculates where to focus the ultrasound. \  \ 5.	A schematic overview of the system has been added to the Implementation section (page 3, below paragraph 2). This clearly illustrates how all components of the system are wired together. \  \ 6.	As proposed by the reviewers, the distinction between open and closed loop scenarios has been removed from the Testing the Implementation section (page 3). The success of the more complex closed loop methods infers that an open loop approach would be possible. This required the final paragraphs of both the Moving Single Objects and Moving Multiple Objects sections (both page 3) to be rewritten to make sense in the new context. \  \ 7.	Due to the previous change, it was no longer necessary to have all 6 filmstrips. We have removed four of them, leaving the two that best portray the tests to the reader (page 3, right hand column). This change provided the space for the schematic overview diagram mentioned above. \  \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 18:14",""

However, this model and its existing extensions are still limited for 2D pointing task especially when the effects of movement direction (θ) remain in the task. In this paper, we employ the concept of projection to account for the effects of target width (W) and height (H) on movement time so that we seamlessly integrate the four factors, i.e. θ, amplitude (A), W and H, into the new extension of Fitts' law, which can uncover not only the periodicity of the asymmetrical impacts of W and H with the variation of θ but also their interrelation. Carrying out two experiments, we verify that the vertical projection of W and the horizontal projection of H in the line of movement direction can be viewed as the determinants of movement time. Finally, we offer recommendations for 2D pointing experiments and discuss the implications for interface designs.","1. Accot, J. and Zhai, S. Beyond Fitts' law: Models for trajectory-based HCI tasks.

The results presented in Figure 7a do not contradict the results presented in Guiard�s work.

In this paper we develop and investigate new methods for filtering and assessing the verity of sources found through social media by journalists.

Emerging water sensing systems, however, can provide detailed usage data at the level of individual water fixtures (i.e., disaggregated usage data). In this paper, we perform formative evaluations of two sets of novel eco-feedback displays that take advantage of this disaggregated data. The first display set isolates and examines specific elements of an eco-feedback design space such as data and time granularity. Displays in the second set act as design probes to elicit reactions about competition, privacy, and integration into domestic space. The displays were evaluated via an online survey of 651 North American respondents and in-home, semi-structured interviews with 10 families (20 adults). Our findings are relevant not only to the design of future water eco-feedback systems but also for other types of consumption (e.g., electricity and gas).","1.

We report on the results of two user studies. The first one compares the quality of the set of thumbnails selected by the technology to sets selected by 31 humans.   The second study examines the clickthrough rates for both email formats (with and without hyperlinked thumbnails) as well as gathering subjective feedback via survey. Results indicate that the email messages with the thumbnails drove significantly higher clickthrough rates than the messages without, even though people clicked on the main video link more frequently than the thumbnails. Survey responses show that users found the email with the thumbnail set significantly more appealing and novel.","1. A. Aula, R. M. Khan, Z. Guan, P. Fontes, and P. Hong.

In this paper, we present a method to determine the relative orientation of proximate mobile devices using only the backside camera. We implemented this method as a service called Orienteer, which provides mobile device with the orientation of other proximate mobile devices. We demonstrate that orientation information can be used to enable novel and natural interactions by developing two applications that allow the user to push content in the direction of another device to share it and point the device toward another to filter content based on the device’s owner. An informal evaluation revealed that interactions built upon orientation information can be natural and compelling to users, but developers and designers need to carefully consider how orientation should be applied effectively.","1.

However, acquiring vocabulary is often a protracted process that requires repeated and spaced exposure; which can be difficult to accommodate given the busyness of daily living. In this paper, we explore if a learner can implicitly acquire second language vocabulary through her explicit interactions with her mobile phone (e.g., navigating multiple home screens) using an interface we developed called Vocabulary Wallpaper. In addition, we examine if the type of vocabulary this technique exposes to the learner, whether it is contextually relevant or contextually-independent will influence the learner’s rate of vocabulary acquisition. The results of our study show participants were able to use Vocabulary Wallpaper to increase the number of second language vocabulary that they can recognize and recall and their rate of vocabulary acquisition was significantly greater when presented with a contextually relevant vocabulary than a contextually-independent vocabulary.","1.

One way of using the 3D space above a horizontal surface is to divide it into discrete parallel layers stacked upon each other. Horizontal and vertical lens movements are essential tasks for the style of multi-layer interaction associated with it. We conducted a comprehensive user study with 18 participants investigating fundamental issues such as optimal number of layers and their thickness, movement and holding accuracies, and physical boundaries of the interaction volume. Findings include a rather limited overall interaction height (44 cm), a different minimal layer thickness for vertical and horizontal search tasks (1 cm/4 cm), a reasonable maximum number of layers depending on the primary task, and a convenience zone in the middle for horizontal search. Derived from that, design guidelines are also presented.","1. E. A. Bier, M. C. Stone, K. Pier, W. Buxton, and T. D. DeRose. Toolglass and Magic Lenses: The See-Through Interface. Proc.

We take advantage of the multi- touch surface to combine biometric techniques with gestural input. We defined a comprehensive set of five-finger touch gestures, based upon classifying movement characteristics of the center of the palm and fingertips, and tested them in a user study combining biometric data collection with usability questions. Using pattern recognition techniques, we built a classifier to recognize unique biometric gesture characteristics of an individual. We achieved a 90% accuracy rate with single gestures, and saw significant improvement when multiple gestures were performed in sequence. We found user ratings of a gestures desirable characteristics (ease, pleasure, excitement) correlated with a gestures actual biometric recognition ratethat is to say, user ratings aligned well with gestural security, in contrast to typical text-based passwords. Based on these results, we conclude that multi-touch gestures show great promise as an authentication mechanism.","1. http://beust.com/weblog2/archives/000497.html. \ 2. http://techcrunch.com/2008/10/12/androids-login-iscool-but-is-it-secure/. \ 3. http://www.passfaces.com/pfphelp/logon.htm. \ 4. http://gestureworks.com/features/open-source-gestures/. \ 5.

Gajos","kgajos@eecs.harvard.edu","We present a method for obtaining lab-quality measurements of pointing performance from unobtrusive observations of natural in situ interactions. Specifically, we have developed a set of user-independent classifiers for discriminating between deliberate, targeted mouse pointer movements and those movements that were affected by any extraneous factors. To develop and validate these classifiers, we developed logging software to unobtrusively record pointer trajectories as participants naturally interacted with their computers over the course of several weeks.  Each participant also performed a set of pointing tasks in a formal study set-up. For each movement, we computed a set of measures capturing nuances of the trajectory and the speed, acceleration, and jerk profiles. Treating the observations from the formal study as positive examples of deliberate, targeted movements and the in situ observations as unlabeled data with an unknown mix of deliberate and distracted interactions, we used a recent advance in machine learning to develop the classifiers. Our results show that, on four distinct metrics, the data collected in-situ and filtered with our classifiers closely matches the results obtained from the formal experiment. \ ","\\begin{thebibliography}{10} \  \ \\bibitem{accot03:refining} \ Accot, J., and Zhai, S. \ \\newblock Refining {Fitts'} law models for bivariate pointing. \ \\newblock In {\\em CHI '03: Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human \   factors in computing systems}, ACM Press (New York, NY, USA, 2003), 193--200. \  \ \\bibitem{chapuis07:fitts} \ Chapuis, O., Blanch, R., and Beaudouin-Lafon, M. \ \\newblock Fitts' law in the wild: A field study of aimed movements. \ \\newblock Tech.

In this paper, we study Google+, which enables users to selectively share content with specific �Circles� of people. Through a combination of log analysis with surveys and interviews, we investigate how active users organize and select audiences for shared content. We find that these users frequently engaged in selective sharing, creating circles to manage content across particular life facets, ties of varying strength, and interest-based groups. Motivations to share spanned personal and informational reasons, and users frequently weighed �limiting� factors (e.g. privacy, relevance, and social norms) against the desire to reach a large audience. Our work identifies implications for the design of selective sharing mechanisms in social networks.","1. Acquisti, A. & Gross, R.

To gain insights into this question, we examined a sample of online patient communities to understand health professionals' involvement in bringing in medical advice into peer-patient conversations. We found the communities fall short in supporting the whole person, because  (1) patient expertise and clinical expertise generated by health professionals are shared separately, and (2) patients' quantified data are separate from narrative experiences. Such separation in the design of these systems can lead to limitations in addressing patients' interwoven medical and personal concerns.

We address a \   challenge to many existing studies of motivation in online contexts: \   they are based on survey self-reports, which are \   susceptible to effects such as social desirability bias. In \   addition we investigate a second challenge to the extant research on \   motivation in the context of MTurk: a failure to examine potential \   differences between MTurk workers (Turkers) from different parts \   of the world, especially those from the US and India, MTurk's two \   largest worker groups. Using a survey technique called the list  \   experiment, we observe distinct profiles of motivation and patterns of  \   social desirability effects among Turkers in the US and India.  \   Among US Turkers, we find that social desirability \   encourages over-reporting of each of four motivating \   factors we examined. The over-reporting was particularly large in \   the case of money as a motivator. In contrast, among Turkers in \   India we find a more complex pattern of social desirability effects, \   with workers under-reporting ``killing time'' and ``fun'' as \   motivations, and drastically over-reporting ``sense of purpose.'' \   We conclude by discussing these results and proposing implications \   for future research and design.","1.

Prior work has noted challenges in justifying them to developers. In contrast, it has been assumed that designers and user experience professionals--whose goal is to focus designs on targeted users--will readily exploit personas. This paper examines that assumption. We present the first study of how experienced user-centered design (UCD) practitioners with prior experience deploying personas, use and perceive personas in industrial software design. We identify limits to the persona approach in the context studied. Practitioners used personas almost exclusively for communication, but not for design. Participants identified four problems with personas, finding them abstract, impersonal, misleading and distracting. Our findings argue for a new approach to persona deployment and construction. Personas cannot replace immersion in actual user data. And rather than focusing on creating engaging personas, it is critical to avoid persona attributes that mislead or distract.","1.

This paper can benefit practitioners who would like to use personas for design.","Tara Matthews","tlmatthe@us.ibm.com","Description of Revisions to CHI Paper #1688: ""How Do Designers and User Experience Professionals Actually Use Personas?"" \  \ Our revisions address all points raised and promised in our rebuttal, as well as the additional points the AC emphasized in their post-CHI-committee meeting notes. Here we summarize the changes and include some key snippets to illustrate the changes (although the full document includes a more extensive treatment of reviewer concerns). \  \ (1) Clarified the contribution and positioned with respect to prior work. \  - Added text to the abstract, intro, related work, and conclusions to clarify the contribution with related to prior work, in line with the AC's suggestion. One snippet: ""This paper examines how UCD practitioners at one company perceive personas' use and value in real industrial product design. It is the first study exploring perceptions of personas in UCD practitioners with prior experience using personas."" \  \ (2) Addressed the issue of generalizability and more carefully worded claims about how findings can be applied. \ - This involved many small wording changes throughout the paper to tone down claims and more carefully explain how they might be applied. \ - Added a section called ""Study Limitations and Generalizablity"" with the following text:  ""Care should be taken applying our results to other organizational contexts without further studies. There are various critical factors that affect a practitioner's use and perception of personas, and hence the generalizability of this study. These include organizational culture, educational background, persona training, and experience. Our participants represent a range of educational backgrounds, persona training, and experience, improving the generalizability across these dimensions within the company studied. However, our study included only one company. This study represents a first step toward understanding how experienced UCD practitioners use and perceive personas in real industrial product design, a currently understudied topic. We hope future studies will explore this question in other organizational contexts, such as design firms and organizations with greater proportions of designers with specialized persona training."" \ - Added a shorter but similar note about generalizability and future work to the conclusion. \  \ (3) Expanded description of the analysis process. \ - Described the analysis process and how we developed the themes and categories presented in the paper: ""Two researchers attended each session, one leading and the other taking detailed notes. Study sessions were audio recorded. Loose transcripts and notes from the sessions were initially analyzed using open coding. We next examined our initial codes and data to identify and formalize recurring themes, which represented meaningful aspects of the empirical material that occurred repeatedly. For example, one theme was that only a few, distinctly different perceptions of personas were expressed repeatedly and we discovered that we could categorize participants by these repeated viewpoints. We performed a second coding pass through the data focused on the formalized themes. Two analysts who had conducted the interviews together went through the themes with examples. Where there was disagreement they discussed the themes and examples until agreement was reached. Our presentation of results focuses on these themes, including quotes that support each theme and illustrate important nuances."" \  \ (6) Clarified the cognitive walkthrough portion of the study. \ - The results of the cognitive walkthrough are presented in another Note accepted to CHI 2012 (#1825). Its purpose was outside the scope of this particular study, though the additional time spent with each participant did yield additional data for this study. We added a reference to this paper and a clarification as to the purpose of the cognitive walkthrough. \  \ (7) Reduced repetition throughout the paper. \  \ (8) Addressed all points raised in our rebuttal, which covered the main reviewer concerns. These include: \ - Added motivating text regarding Cooper's original intention for personas (R1). \ - Clarified which participants used personas versus which did not, and clearly defined these categories (R2). \ - Clarified how time was allocated during the study session. \ - Clarified the purpose of the study personas. \ - Clarified the differentiation between the role of personas in design and communication. \ - Noted that our study results may not apply in cases when personas are used as a stopgap method when user research is not possible. \ - We also addressed various other minor issues from reviewers. \ ","","design, user experience","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 20:13",""

Often, users locate the content using a search engine, copy it into their work, cross their fingers, and hope they do not infringe on any copyrights. While the authors have shared hundreds of millions of images with permissive licenses, the license terms are too complicated for other users to follow. In our studies, we found that even the well-intentioned users still fail to respect copyrights in simple image reuse situations.

The design will reduce accidental copyright infringements and the time needed for searching open content.","Herkko Hietanen","herkko.hietanen@hiit.fi","We addressed all the important points raised by MR. These points are; 1) Add technical implementation details of the OMR model, 2) Provide a better analysis of the social practices associated with media reuse.  \ We addressed (1) by elaborating the current description on OMR model. Now the section on OMR model provides more information on implementation of applications that follow the OMR model. It specifies minimum requirements for implementing an application that works on any open content. Since the goal of OMR model is to provide a general design pattern, detailed implementation instructions cannot be provided. However, the two prototypes - Open Media Ribbon and AudioImager- serve the goal of exemplifying how OMR model can be followed.  \ The point (2) is addressed in the Discussion section of the paper. Social aspects related to the fair use of content are addressed by presenting the attribution problem as a combination of social, motivational and design related dimensions. And also more precise design implications that are geared to the social aspects in addition to the general interaction design issues are presented.   \ In addition to MR�s major requests, there was a comment on the limited number of participants in our studies. We have addressed this issue by discussing the effect of small number of participants on findings along with the overall research approach in the Discussion section of the paper. And also future research questions are further presented following from the limitations of the studies presented in the paper. \  In order to make room for these changes, we have removed 1) much of the discussion related to crowdsourcing, preserving only the idea that metadata can be used to improve search engine results; and 2) the lengthy reiteration of interaction-level differences between Open Media Ribbon and AudioImager related to the sidebar vs within-workspace search functionality. We find that these removals have not changed the primary message of our paper, which is related to the requirements for helping people better follow open content license requirements.  \ In addition to these major changes we also added a table summarizing the statistical analysis as requested by R3. We also restructured the section �The Cost of Media Retrieval Process� to give a better meaning to the sub-categories of costs of the media retrieval process. And also the �Related Work� section is improved to smooth the flow of the paper.  We also used professional proof readers to repair the language errors. \ ","","design, user experience","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 20:01",""

As a person adds members to a group, ReGroup iteratively learns a probabilistic model of group membership specific to that group. ReGroup then uses its currently learned model to suggest additional members and group characteristics for filtering. Our evaluation shows that ReGroup is effective for helping people create large and varied groups, whereas traditional methods (searching by name or selecting from an alphabetical list) are better suited for small groups whose members can be easily recalled by name. By facilitating on demand group creation, ReGroup can enable in-context sharing and potentially encourage better online privacy practices. In addition, applying interactive machine learning to social network group creation introduces several challenges for designing effective end-user interaction with machine learning. We identify these challenges and discuss how we address them in ReGroup.","1. Amershi, S., Fogarty, J., Kapoor, A. and Tan, D.

Our depth camera tracks the user�s eyes and performs a real-time capture of both the shape and the appearance of any object placed in front of the camera (including user�s body and hands). This real-time capture enables perspective stereoscopic 3D visualizations to a single user that account for deformations caused by physical objects on the table. In addition, the user can interact with virtual objects through physically-realistic freehand actions without any gloves, trackers, or instruments. We illustrate these unique capabilities through three application examples: virtual 3D model creation, interactive gaming with real and virtual objects, and a 3D teleconferencing experience that not only presents a 3D view of a remote person, but also a seamless 3D shared task space. We also evaluated the user�s perception of projected 3D objects in our system, which confirmed that the users can correctly perceive such objects even when they are projected over different background colors and geometries (e.g., gaps, drops).

In this paper, we go beyond measurement of user behavior to  prediction of the resulting user experience from mouse patterns alone. Specifically, we identify mouse markers that can predict user frustration and reading struggles at reasonably high accuracy. We believe that mouse-based prediction of user experience is an important advance, and could potentially offer a scalable way to infer user experience on the web. In addition, we demonstrate that mouse tracking could be used for applications such as evaluating content layout and content noticeability; we apply this in particular to advertisements. More generally, it could  be used to infer user attention in complex webpages containing images, text and varied content,  including how attention patterns  vary  with page layout and user distraction.","1.

We have addressed all their comments in the revised paper. Some changes are highlighted below. \  \ On the relevance of these findings on mouse to touch screens and track pads, we added the following: ""The findings reported in this study are obtained from users consuming content via desktop PCs using a mouse. While this is currently the most popular way of consuming content on the web, newer technologies such as touch screens and track pads are increasingly becoming popular. Thus another interesting direction for future work will be to explore whether and how mouse tracks on touch screens and track pads relate to user attention and experience, which is beyond the scope of this paper."" \  \ On the comment that the scale of the study was small, we added the following: ""The current findings are from lab studies involving 20 to 90 participants. Future work will involve testing these findings at larger scale, and in determining differences due to age, gender and other factors, which are beyond the scope of this paper."" \  \ In response to the AC's comment to make improvements suggested by R3, we did the following.  \  \ 1. We added more information on the methods and procedure: ""The raw mouse and eye tracks were obtained from Tobii 1750 eye tracker. These were tuples of the format: (x, y, t) indicating the x,y coordinate of the mouse/eye and the corresponding timestamp. We parsed these to obtain the (x,y,t�) where t� is relative to when the page loads. We further parsed the eye tracking data to obtain eye fixations (brief pauses in the eye) and saccades (abrupt jump in eye position) using standard algorithms described in [1]. We extracted measures such as the number of eye fixations, dwell time per fixation, total dwell time, saccade length, amount of re-reading (%fixations that revisit previously read content), saccade length of re-reading (distance by which the eye travels while re-reading). We followed a similar procedure for parsing mouse tracks: we record a �mouse visit� on a page element (e.g., ad) when the instantaneous mouse position of the mouse lies within that element. We obtain the following measures: number of mouse visits per element, dwell per visit, total dwell time by mouse, distance travelled by the mouse between successive visits, % of mouse revisits to previously read content, distance travelled by the mouse during the revisits. \  [1] G. Buscher, E. Cutrell, and M. Morris. What do you see when you�re surfing?: Using eye tracking to predict salient regions of web pages. CHI 2009."" \  \ 2.

Guy","guy@cs.toronto.edu","Visually impaired pedestrians experience unique challenges when navigating an urban environment because many cues about orientation and traffic patterns are difficult to ascertain without the use of vision. Technological aids such as customized GPS navigation tools offer the chance to augment visually impaired pedestrians� sensory information with a richer depiction of an environment, but care must be taken to balance the need for more information with other demands on the senses. In this paper, we focus on the information needs of visually impaired pedestrians at intersections, which present a specific cause of stress when navigating in unfamiliar locations. We present a navigation application prototype called CrossingGuard that provides rich information to a user such as details about intersection geometry that are not available to visually impaired pedestrians today. A user study comparing content-rich information to a baseline condition shows that content-rich information raises the level of comfort that visually impaired pedestrians feel at unfamiliar intersections. In addition, we discuss the categories of information that are most useful. Finally, we introduce a micro-task approach to gather intersection data via Street View annotations that achieves 85.5% accuracy over the 9 categories of information used by CrossingGuard.","1.

However, it is unclear how useful different types of information are for people to make expertise judgments and to what extent their background knowledge influences their judgments. This study explored differences between experts and novices in inferring expertise of Twitter users. In three conditions, participants rated the level of expertise of users after seeing (1) only the tweets, (2) only the contextual information including short biographical and user list information, and (3) both tweets and contextual information. Results indicated that, in general, contextual information provides more useful information for making expertise judgment of Twitter users than tweets. While the addition of tweets seems to make little difference, or even add nuances to novices� expertise judgment, experts� judgments were improved when both content and contextual information were presented.","1.

In order to achieve optimal performance with such applications, users typically need to transition to an alternative efficient behavior. Often, features of such alternative behaviors are not initially accessible and first need to be customized. However, few research works formally study and empirically measure what drives a user to customize. In this paper, we describe the challenges involved in empirically studying customization behaviors, and propose a methodology for formally measuring the impact of potential customization factors. We then demonstrate this methodology by studying the impact of different customization factors on customization behaviors. Our results show that increasing exposure and awareness of customization features, and adding social influence can significantly affect the user's customization behavior.","1.

We have also drawn parallels between these factors and the customization factors we defined in our paper. \  \ R4 raised concerns about the process of identifying the participant expertise levels. We have clarified this process in the ""Participant expertise levels"" section: ""The customization behavior questions asked about the amount of customization (if any) and the type of customization the user would perform (e.g. personalizing Gmail account look, customizing Word command ribbon, modifying Word templates, creating Excel macros, etc.). This was done to account for different levels of customization experience [M�rch, 1997]."" \  \ R4 pointed out that some conclusions in the paper might be overgeneralized and might not extend to other complex systems. We have toned down our claims and clarified in the conclusion that additional studies are required to test whether our findings would generalize to other complex systems: ""Also, our findings provide grounding for follow-up field studies with more complex and real-world software applications to test whether our results would extend to such systems."" \  \ R1 requested clarification on our reasoning for suggesting a single primary task with a reasonable cognitive load, and suggested an alternative conclusion that studies should include tasks that vary in cognitive load. In the ""Task Complexity"" section we have added the alternative conclusion and have clarified out decision to use a single task with a reasonable cognitive load: ""To achieve a higher degree of external validity, the study may need to include tasks that vary in cognitive load. However, due to limited duration of lab experiments, it might not be possible to test different tasks. In such cases the study should include at least a single primary task with a reasonable cognitive load."" \  \ Both R4 and R1 believe that a more detailed discussion of Mackay's work about customization factors would strengthen the paper. We have added to our discussion of Mackay's work and also have explicitly cited and included into our discussion Mackay's earlier work on social influence factors in customization (Mackay, Patterns of sharing customizable software. CSCW '90, 209-221.). \  \ R2 pointed out that the paper could benefit from a discussion ""about the underlying assumption of time being a motivation factor for users"". We have added clarification about this to the ""Procedure"" section: ""The instructions asked participants to perform the task as quickly and as accurately as possible. But the actual amount of time participants had to spend on the study was completely dependent on their own performance. As such, participants had an implicit motivation to complete the study efficiently."" \  \ In addition to the changes above, we have addressed other reviewer comments. We have added work by Page et al. [CHI 96], changed the inconsistent terminology, and corrected the typos. We have clarified Fig 6 and have ensured it reads well in black and white. We have added explanation for Fig 7 that the total number of participants in each condition was 16. We have clarified how the participants were asked about how much impact the assigned condition had on their strategy. We have also clarified that our results about performance speed of users in the social condition could be due to competition rather than benefits of customization. \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 20:21",""

We employed both quantitative measures such as computer log data and ethnographic methods to compare a baseline condition (normal email usage) with our experimental manipulation (email cutoff). Our results show that without email, people multitasked less and had a longer task focus, as measured by a lower frequency of shifting between windows and a longer duration of time spent working in each computer window. Further, we directly measured stress using wearable heart rate monitors and found that stress, as measured by heart rate variability, was lower without email. Interview data were consistent with our quantitative measures, as participants reported being able to focus more on their tasks.

Based on these results, we present Swift, a technique that supports real-time scrubbing of online videos by overlaying a small, low resolution copy of the video during video scrubbing, and snapping back to the high resolution video when the scrubbing is completed or paused. A second study compares the Swift technique to traditional online video players on a collection of realistic live motion videos and content-specific search tasks which finds the Swift technique reducing completion times by as much as 72% even with a relatively low latency of 500ms. Lastly, we demonstrate that the Swift technique can be easily implemented using modern HTML5 web standards.","1. Bachmann, T. (1991).

We present Delta, an interactive workflow visualization and comparison tool that helps users identify the tradeoffs between workflows. We conducted an initial study to identify the set of attributes users attend to when comparing workflows, finding that they consider result quality, their knowledge of commands, and the efficiency of the workflow. We then designed Delta to surface these attributes at three granularities: a high-level, clustered view; an intermediate-level list view that contains workflow summaries; and a low-level detail view that allows users to compare two individual workflows. Finally, we conducted an evaluation of Delta on a small corpus of 30 workflows and found that the intermediate list view provided the best information density. We conclude with thoughts on how such a workflow comparison system could be scaled up to larger corpora in the future.","1. Andrews, K., Wohlfahrt, M., and Wurzinger, G. Visual Graph Comparison.

We present See Me, See You, a lightweight approach for discriminating user touches on a vision-based tabletop. We contribute a valuable characterization of finger orientation distributions of tabletop users. We exploit this biometric trait with a machine learning approach to allow the system to predict the correct position of users as they touch the surface. We achieve accuracies as high as 98% in simple situations and above 92% in more challenging conditions, such as two-handed tasks. We show high acceptance from users, who can self-correct prediction errors without significant costs. See Me, See You is a viable solution for providing simple yet effective support for multi-user application features on tabletops.","1. Annett, M., Grossman, T. and Fitzmaurice, G.

Prior work suggests that affordances of social media might highlight and shape these tensions; to explore this, we asked 20 people to reflect daily for two weeks on feelings and decisions around their own and others' Facebook use related to their relationships. Most generally, we find that tensions arise when romantic partners must manage multiple relationships simultaneously because Facebook audiences are so present and so varied. People also engage in subtle negotiation around and appropriation of Facebook's features to accomplish both personal and relational goals. By capturing both why people make these decisions and how Facebook's affordances support them, we expect our findings to generalize to many other social media tools and to inform theorizing about how these tools affect relational development.","1.

Yet from our experiences on these mass participation systems and a survey of the literature, we identify a number of reported difficulties. We propose a hybrid methodology that aims to address these, by combining a global software release with a concurrent local trial. A phone–based game, created to explore the uptake and use of ad hoc peer-to-peer networking, was evaluated using this new hybrid trial method, combining a small-scale local trial (11 users) with a ‘mass participation’ trial (over 10,000 users). Our hybrid method offers many benefits, allowing locally observed findings to be verified, patterns in globally collected data to be explained and addresses ethical issues raised by the mass participation approach. We note trends in the local trial that did not appear in the larger scale deployment, and which would therefore have led to misleading results were the application trialled using ‘traditional’ methods alone. Based on this study and previous experience, we provide a set of guidelines to researchers working in this area.","1.

We present a comparative study of design and user experience practitioners who used both collaboration personas and individual personas. Participants conducted a cognitive walkthrough and provided redesign suggestions for a collaboration tool. Our results show that the focus of the cognitive walkthrough and redesign task differed, with collaboration personas showing more group focus. Collaboration personas led to a more complete discussion, as indicated by a greater amount of time spent on the task compared to individual personas. Despite prior experience and training with individual personas, collaboration personas were preferred and better supported the task, since they focused on groups of people and their interactions.","1.

Here we summarize the changes and include some key snippets to illustrate the changes (although the full document includes a more thorough treatment of reviewer concerns). \  \ (1) Clarified the Method section about participants' prior experience with the individual persona (IP).  \ 	- Added this text: ""Only participants from product division B had ever seen or used Gerard (8 out of 15 participants)."" \  \ (2) Clarified the Method section about how the IP was selected. \ 	- Added this text: ""We selected Gerard after reviewing all of division B's primary personas. It was the highest quality persona as it was rich in detail and contained content considered important by [1,2,7]. Several other personas lacked key information and/or sufficient detail. Gerard was also used for the design of the tool evaluated in the study task and his job was highly collaborative."" \  \ (3) Discussed how the IP and CP relate to each other and referenced copies of both made available online. \ 	- Added this text: ""The CP and IP were similar in that both included goals, responsibilities, work style descriptions, and tools used. However, even these 'overlapping' topics were very different in their focus and specifics, since the IP and CP were created with different objectives and guidelines. They did not overlap in their text and images."" \ 	- Added links to online versions of both personas used in the study. \  \ (4) Added a clear ""limitations"" paragraph that discusses multiple persona use and novelty effects. \ 	- The limitations includes the following text:  \  \ One limitation of the work is that we provided only short-term exposure to the CP, thus our results need to be verified with a longitudinal study in the future. Also, design teams commonly use multiple IPs, so the study setup with a single IP was not totally realistic. However, we do not expect our main result (that CPs better focus designers on collaboration) to be different if our study had included multiple IPs. Multiple IPs typically do not explicitly form a team (this is discouraged in personas literature), so interaction between individual IPs and their group roles would remain unstated, encouraging any collaborative aspects to be 'made up.' \  \  \ (5) Clarified our completion time measure \ 	- Rearranged the section to focus on qualitative observations. \ 	- Removed claims that it could measure ""engagement"" and focused on ""completion,"" which is strongly supported by our qualitative analysis. \ 	- Added this text: ""To confirm that familiarity with the IP did not cause these differences, we performed an unpaired t-test finding no significant difference between the task times for participants who had (N=8) and had not (N=7) previously used Gerard, for the IP (p=0.20) and CP (p=0.43). We do not believe complexity of the CP caused higher task times either, since the IP at 5 pages was far longer than the CP at 3 pages. Participants told us the CP was clear and easy to use; we received no comments about it being difficult to understand."" \ ","","design, user experience","ContentComplete","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 19:22",""

The TeleHuman 3D videoconferencing system supports 360 degree motion parallax as the viewer moves around the cylinder and optionally, stereoscopic 3D display of the remote person. We evaluated the effect of perspective cues on the conveyance of nonverbal cues in two experiments using a one-way telecommunication version of the system. The first experiment focused on how well the system preserves gaze and hand pointing cues. The second experiment evaluated how well the system conveys 3D body postural information. We compared 3 perspective conditions: a conventional 2D view, a 2D view with 360 degree motion parallax, and a stereoscopic view with 360 degree motion parallax. Results suggest the combined presence of motion parallax and stereoscopic cues significantly improved the accuracy with which participants were able to assess gaze and hand pointing cues, and to instruct others on 3D body poses. The inclusion of motion parallax and stereoscopic cues also led to significant increases in the sense of social presence and telepresence reported by participants.","1.

The tab-letop affords multi-touch input, allowing digital content to be sorted, triaged and interacted with using one or two-handed interactions. A physics-based simulation adds dy-namics to digital content, providing users with rich ways of interacting that borrows from the real-world. The field study is one of the first of a surface computer within a do-mestic environment. Our goal is to uncover people�s inter-actions, appropriations, perceptions and experiences with such technologies, exploring the potential barriers to use. Given these devices provide such a revolutionary shift in interaction, will people be able to engage with them in eve-ryday life in the ways we intend? In answering this ques-tion, we hope to deepen our understanding of the design of such systems for home and consumer domains.","1. Agarawala, A. and Balakrishnan, R. 2006.

","david kirk","david.kirk@newcastle.ac.uk","We have added an entire new section that hopefully captures the main findings that were clearly captured in the rebuttal.  \  \ 1) Flexibility of hand configurations and rapid transitions. We observed regular single finger, multiple fingers and bimanual hand configurations during the study. Users implicitly transitioned between different hand and finger-based configurations, and we feel that it is important for designers not to overly prescribe a single model. Bimanual interactions of this kind were not observed in shorter term studies e.g. [19] and only emerged due to prolonged interaction with the system (> 1 week). This is a crucial finding that goes against prior work such as [19].  \ 2) Causes of hand configurations and transitions. Many different factors impacted user hand configurations. For example, when users perceived that a virtual physics object needed to be stabilized or controlled, they switched to using a single finger (which interestingly is not the way we typi-cally bring a physical object under control). The fidelity of the task also resulted in different hand poses. Users switched from single and multi-finger for finely controlling a single object, to using two hands for coarse multi-object interactions. Another under explored factor was that of the confidence the user has in the system. For example, if the system failed to respond in a predictable way, the user typi-cally reduced the number of fingers interacting.  \ 3) Perceptions of tabletop device and physics-based inter-actions. Hand-based interactions and physics allowed users to learn the system in ways they would not have been able to with a regular computer. They saw it as a hybrid virtual/digital world. Beyond a regular PC, but had some reservations due to the fact that it was still �technology�. \ 4) Battling between virtual and real analogies. We ob-served how on many occasions the mental model of the user was battling between real world analogies and their experiences of WIMP. This can lead to confusion and in-teresting findings. e.g. users assumed less fingers would give more control for physics-enabled virtual objects (less like the real world), but also trying to open boxes using double click instead of using real world metaphor. \ 5) Literal translation of the real world is not always good for tabletop design. Some of the physics interactions made for hard work for the user, and the virtual space was limited due to the 3D physics. This shows that simply replicating the real in the virtual is not without its downsides, and ultimately these metaphors should be used liberally and not always literally.  \ 6) Tabletops are not always beneficial for collaboration. There is a huge body of work on tabletop systems for col-laboration. However, in practice we saw little examples of collaboration. People genuinely avoided simultaneous use and would often become agitate each other interacting side by side.  \ 7) Challenge the term natural user interaction (NUI). We often think that NUI means touch based input. For children in our study natural meant the mouse and double click. Evidence from the study really demonstrates that �natural� is an overloaded and often confused term. \  \ We have also fixed various other points in the paper including typos and have included details of whether users had experience of previous touch devices.  \ ","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 17:38",""

Recovery requires hundreds of daily repetitions of therapeutic exercises, often without therapist supervision. When performing therapy alone, people with limited motion often compensate for the lack of motion in one joint by moving another one. This compensation can impede the recovery progress and create new health problems. In this work we contribute (1) a methodology to reliably sense compensatory torso motion in the context of shoulder exercises done by persons with stroke and (2) the design and experimental evaluation of operant-conditioning-based strategies for games that aim to reduce compensatory torso motion. Our results show that these strategies significantly reduce compensatory motions compared to alternatives.","1. Adamovich, S.V., Merians, A.S., Boian, R., et al.

","Daniel Vogel","dan@nonsequitoria.com","NOTE: Numbers enclosed in square parenthesis (like [#1]) refer to the 10 points raised by the AC,  which we proposed revisions in our rebuttal. \  \ [#1] Improved explanation of how target diameters where chosen: �The smallest diameter is three times the minimum recommended touch target [11], the largest based on anthropomorphic palm size [17], and intermediate sizes selected to easily accommodate posture contact(s). We wanted to balance the ease-of-selection with location constraints.� \  \ [#2] Improved explanation of how incorrect contacts were prevented: �For most postures, our code prevented interaction unless the correct number of contacts were on the target.� \  \ [#3] Improved explanation of 333ms delay: �This short delay reduced motion blur and increased the tolerance for event log synchronization for the point-of-view frame captures, addressing problems reported by Vogel et al [25].� \  \ [#4] Added missing transform tolerance and corrected conversion errors in some reported task error tolerances: 30 mm for drag and rotate, 15 mm for scale, 45 mm for scale up/down distance. \  \ [#5] Rewrote paragraph to break out the training and non-dominant hand condition subsets and give our reasoning to use a subset: �Before beginning the main experiment blocks, participants completed 26 practice trials: 1 centre Tap trial for each Posture; 1 Drag trial for each Posture to a random outer grid position; and all permutations of Transform trials. After the main experiment, participants completed 72 trials with their non-dominant hand covering a subset of Conditions for all Tasks and Postures: 5 Tap trials for each Posture and all grid positions except corners; 4 Drag trials for each Posture to grid positions except corners; and 8 Transform trials covering all Conditions except two-handed. We elected to use this subset of conditions to reduce experiment time and fatigue, but provide enough data to see any pronounced differences between hands. The experiment took less than 1 hour to complete.�  Note the number of ND trials was 72, not 104. \  \ [#5] Clarified limitation to non-dominant hand in results section: �We also examined mean occlusion silhouettes for the non-dominant hand. There are no pronounced differences, but the smaller set of tested conditions does limit this result.� and in designer templates section: �We did not see pronounced differences between dominant and non-dominant silhouettes in the subset of tested conditions, so designers should be able to mirror and union the right-handed template when designing for either hand.� \  \ [#6] Clarified how shapes were registered in �Results/Shape of Occluded Area� section: �These are created by registering all silhouettes by target grid position (the actual centroid is not robust for palm, side, and fist postures) ...�   \ We mistakenly said we used contact centroid in our rebuttal, but the actual centroid is only used for testing the geometric model because it is all that would be available in a non DI set-up. Due to variance in centroids for palm, side, fist, we use the grid position for experiment analysis and consider it an ideal or expected contact centroid.  \ In the �Occlusion area templates for designers� section: �Each template is a dimension-calibrated image showing areas which may be occluded relative to the expected contact centroid.� \ In �Testing Models� section: �; we use the actual contact centroid ...� \  \ [#7] Added �typically� to clarify forearm angle in �Individual Participants: section: �...typically points down to the lower-right.�  \  \ [#8] Improve explanation of how descriptive statistic radii were selected in Figure 3 caption: �Segmentation radii were selected by trial and error: for breadth and angle, they roughly segment silhouettes into hand and forearm slices; for area, this gives a measure of localized occlusion, which is admittedly arbitrary, but more generalisable than Vogel et al.�s occlusion area measure as the ratio of a 12"" display.� \  \ [#9] More directly discussed limitations of MS Surface in conclusion: �Although the Microsoft Surface is popular and has spawned other similarly-sized tables, taller and larger tables could influence body posture and resulting occlusion. More broadly, an obvious question is how well would our results generalize to other multi-touch devices like a phone, tablet, other tables, inclined desks, or vertical walls.� \  \ [#9] We improved the generalizability of model testing by re-running the model fitting analysis to include drag and the palm, side, and fist postures. We now report F1 results across all one-handed postures and tasks, but still focus our discussion on F1 results for only 1 to 5 finger tasks since our geometric model is primarily useful for non-DI devices where only individual finger contacts are sensed, not postures like palm, fist, and side.  \  \  [#9] Acknowledged the likely two finger pinch bias in results section: �However, this may be a bias since 21 participants reported experience with multi-touch phones or tablets.� \  \ [#10] Refined the discussion about body posture in conclusion to acknowledge potential when reaching for targets at extreme edges: �. The biggest shape change across target locations was due to forearm angle, which is a non-issue with small devices. However, body postures may contort more drastically when reaching targets at extreme edges of a large surface.� (R3) \  \ Refined the discussion of user location limitation in the conclusion and acknowledged it much earlier in the �Apparatus� subsection : �A fixed body position is a necessary experimental control, and our results are relative to this.� (2AC).  Also changed body proximity sensing to more complete reference from UIST 2011 [1]. \  \ Refined the description of the methodology in the introduction on page 1 (R1) \  \ Defined �digit� when the term first used in �Gesture Set� on page 3: �(�digit� includes �fingers� and �thumb�)� (R1) \  \ Fixed reference formats and completed missing page numbers and conference names.

The technique is particularly useful for Kinect, where the structured light source is not modulated. Our technique requires only mechanical augmentation of the Kinect, without any need to modify the internal electronics, firmware or associated host software. It is therefore simple to replicate. We show qualitative and quantitative results highlighting the improvements made to interfering Kinect depth signals. The camera frame rate is not compromised, which is a problem in approaches that modulate the structured light source. Our technique is non-destructive and does not impact depth values or geometry. We discuss uses for our technique, in particular within instrumented rooms that require simultaneous use of multiple overlapping fixed Kinect cameras to support whole room interactions. ","1.

WebCrystal con-tributes novel interaction techniques that let the user quickly access HTML and CSS information by selecting questions regarding how a selected element is designed. It pro-vides answers using a textual description and a customized code snippet that can be copied-and-pasted to recreate the desired properties. WebCrystal also supports combining the styles and structures from multiple elements into the generated code snippet, and provides visualizations on the web page itself to explain layout relationships. Our user study shows that WebCrystal helped both novice and experienced developers complete more tasks successfully using significantly less time. ","1. Brandt, J., Guo, P.

A grounded theory approach was taken to categorize 935 usability problems from the evaluation. Four major categories emerged: Physical presentation, Content, Information Architecture and Interactivity. Each major category had between 5 and 16 sub-categories. The categories and sub-categories were then analysed for whether they were found by users only, experts only or both users and experts.  This allowed us to develop an evidence-based set of 21 heuristics to assist in the development and evaluation of interactive websites.","1. Batra, S. and Bishu, R.R. (2007).

To address concerns about permutation, we also expanded the related works to clarify the motivation and precedence of our permutations conditions, by bringing in both our previous work as well as the perceptual work in theories of aggregation based on shape. To address this same concern we clarify the asymmetry of the linegraph and heatmap permutations in our methods section.  \  \ We corrected an error in the data collection and generation code, and re-ran our statistical analyses to reflect the more accurate corrected data.  \  \ We expanded on the limitations and tradeoffs of our proposed experimental designs in the discussion section.  \ We have tried to address R2's technical concern about permutations. Their comment is unclear to us: we have responded to several interpretations of it. We have emphasized that permutations are not meant to be a practical design, that there are potential for issues in using permutations such as false patterns, that other effects from the permutations may influence the results, and the importance of the vertical dimension in all displays (including linegraphs).  \  \ To further address the reviewers' concerns about the study's impact we expanded our conclusion's discussion of the real world utility of our results.","","","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 19:53",""

However, all existing systems for sharing these spaces have an inherent weakness: they cannot share arbitrary physical and digital objects on arbitrary surfaces. We present IllumiShare, a new cost-effective, light-weight device that solves this issue. It both shares physical and digital objects on arbitrary surfaces and provides rich referential awareness. To evaluate IllumiShare, we studied pairs of children playing remotely. They used IllumiShare to share the task-reference space and Skype Video to share the person space. The study results show that IllumiShare shared the play space in a natural and seamless way. We also found that children preferred having both spaces compared to having only one. Moreover, we found that removing the task-reference space caused stronger negative disruptions to the play task and engagement level than removing the person space. Similarly, we found that adding the task-reference space resulted in stronger positive disruptions.","1.

We focus first on issues related to the system, then the study, and then the rest. \ =============== \ System: \ =============== \ Original rebuttal comment: AC, R2 � Technical Details: We will add a discussion of the technical details that (a) describes keystone correction, calibration, focus, and occlusion issues and their solutions, and (b) states which solutions are automated, manual, and how those that are manual can be automated. \ Changes in paper: We added a �PixIO Setup� subsection in the PixIO section. \ =============== \ Original rebuttal comment: R1, R2 � Shared Area Layering, Clearing, and Information Overlap: We will provide a discussion of these effects, including how local physical objects, captured remote physical objects, and digital objects are layered in two-way and n-way collaborations (R2). We will also describe how our participants cleared the area (R1) and include examples of how they divided the area for some tasks and overlapped their actions playfully in others (R1). \ Changes in paper: We added a diagram of the layering of physical and digital objects in a two-way scenario. Please see Figure 6 in the paper. We also added our observations of how our participants cleared the shared are and gave examples of when they chose to divide it to avoid conflicts and when they conflicted playfully on purpose. Please see the second paragraph of the �Play Observations� subsection in the �User Study Results� section. \ =============== \ Original rebuttal comment: R3 � Sharing Physical Objects: The issue of limits of physical object sharing is important. Although these limits did not seem to hamper our participants, they can be problematic for some tasks. We will describe both relevant tasks our participants performed successfully and also give examples of tasks that cannot be done well. As for a video, regretfully, we did not submit one. It would have helped make this and some other issues clearer; however, given a chance to present our work, we plan to incorporate heavy video footage into the talk. \ Changes in paper: We have added this issue to our discussion. Please see the last paragraph in the �PixIO Improvements� subsection of the �Discussion� section. \ =============== \ Study: \ =============== \ Original rebuttal comment: R2, R3 � Additional Studies: Comparing PixIO to other related systems (R3) is an excellent study idea. Our study did not do such comparisons as it was an exploration of interplay between person and task-reference spaces. Exploring WYSIWIS-related issues is also an interesting idea (R2). Moreover, doing a deeper dive with fewer participants in longer sessions (R2) is another great idea. We will incorporate these ideas into our evaluation plan. We will also include a discussion of the issues that motivate these evaluations. \ Changes in paper: We have included additional future work directions for PixIO evaluations. Please see the last paragraph of the �Conlusion� section. \ =============== \ Original rebuttal comment: R1 � Children�s Relationship: We explicitly recruited pairs who knew each other (stated in paper). One pair was twin boys while other pairs were not siblings. This detail will be added to the paper. \ Changes in paper: We have clarified this in the �Participants� subsection of the �User Study� section. \ =============== \ Other: \ =============== \ Original rebuttal comment: AC, R2, R3 � Missing References: We will add Digital Desk, Commune, and VideoArms to our related work. Thank you for bringing these to our attention. \ Changes in paper: We have added all three of these works to our related work. Please see the �Previous Surface Sharing Systems� subsection in the �PixIO� section. \ =============== \ Original rebuttal comment: R2 � Errors in Related Work: We present related work based on published papers, and we apologize if we misrepresented any details. We will contact the authors to help us correct the errors. \ Changes in paper: We talked with the authors of PlayTogether (Andy Wilson), VideoDraw (John Tang), and Share Table (Svetlana Yarosh) as these systems are most closely related to PixIO and we did not find any errors in our descriptions of these systems.  \ =============== \ Original rebuttal comment: R1 � Introduction Questions: We will connect our general questions and the study questions. The former are more general versions of the latter. \ Changes in the paper: We have reworked the introduction so that the study questions are presented as instances of our general questions in the context of children�s remote play. Please see the �Introduction� section. \ =============== \ Original rebuttal comment: Small Errors: We will fix all of the spelling and grammar mistakes the reviewers discovered. \ Changes in paper: We corrected all errors identified by the reviewers. \ ===============","","","ContentComplete","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 19:58",""

Current practice is anchored on the assumption that faces and names draw attention; the same presentation format is used independently of the social connection strength and the search query topic. The key findings of our experiments indicate room for improvement. First, only certain social contacts are useful sources of information, depending on the search topic. Second, faces lose their well-documented power to draw attention when rendered small as part of a social search result annotation. Third, and perhaps most surprisingly, social annotations go largely unnoticed by users in general due to selective, structured visual parsing behaviors specific to search result pages. We conclude by recommending improvements to the design and content of social annotations to make them more noticeable and useful. \ ","1. Ackerman, M., and Malone, T.

The use of recommended links was positively associated with general knowledge, while the use of regular Web links was positively associated with processing capacity.

We present findings from a laboratory evaluation of the CC method with usability practitioners, in which the results of the CC walkthrough were compared to a benchmark set of problems collected via user testing with two experimental Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system tasks. The development of this  new usability  evaluation method was driven by the need for an approach that assesses the adequacy of the system's  support  for reducing the user's cognitive and physical effort in the context of the interaction.","1.

R2 also raises this issue suggesting that there were many  differences in the results from the practitioners team and is perhaps speculating whether differences between the professionals themselves may account for this. \  \      To illuminate the relevant differences between evaluator teams we have: \      * updated Table 2 to include ""Total Years in Field"" column, described in text as: ""The last column in the table specifies the combined total number of years that the two evaluators in each team have spent performing usability evaluations in the field."" \      * added the following text immediately preceding the subsection ""Predictions by Severity"": \       ""The differences in their approaches to the evaluation may be a result of the Task 2 teams having much more field experience than the Task 1 teams (see table 2)."" \  \  \ META-REVIEW >  R1 and R4 both question how easy it would be for ""an analyst to put  him/herself in the position of considering users with a range of different experiences"".  The authors  should address this point. \  \      To address this point, we added the following text immediately preceding the subsection ""Detecting and Evaluating Errors"": \      ""Question 2 is the only one that asks evaluators to consider users with a ""range of experiences."" This aspect of the question may have caused difficulties in the assessment due to the various ways that the evaluators might have accounted for that range.

Consideration of  these would strengthen the paper. \   \       In response to R1's comments we have made the following edits: \        \        Comment 1. Added the definition of ERP to the abstract \  \        Comment 2. In the first sentence,  elaborated  ""usability remains a challenge"" into ""usability remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity of designing for a broad range of users performing a variety of interconnected tasks"" \  \        Comment 4. Explained the meaning of ""context"" in the end of paragraph 1, column 2 as ""the task context and the user's experience and role"". \  \        Comment 5,6. Added a reference and text in second paragraph of the Related Work: "" as we found in our field studies [4], they [errors] are a major source of user angst and a time sink for diagnosing and fixing problems yet are ordinarily overlooked in usability evaluations. \  \        Comment 8.

However, dictation systems today follow a mentally disruptive speech interaction model: users must first formulate utterances and then produce them, as they would with a voice recorder. Because utterances do not get transcribed until users have finished speaking, the entire output appears and users must break their train of thought to verify and correct it. In this paper, we introduce Voice Typing, a new speech interaction model where users’ utterances are transcribed as they produce them to enable real-time error identification. For fast correction, users leverage a marking menu using touch gestures. Voice Typing aspires to create an experience akin to having a secretary type for you, while you monitor and correct the text. In a user study where participants composed emails using both Voice Typing and traditional dictation, they not only reported lower cognitive demand for Voice Typing but also exhibited 29% relative reduction of user corrections. Overall, they also preferred Voice Typing.","1. Aist, G., Allen, J., Campana, E., Gallo, C., Stoness, S., Swift, M., and Tanenhaus, M.K.

The essay has three parts. In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.","1.

Beautification is based on a novel algorithm that iter- \ atively computes various sub-components of the components \ using an extensible set of deductive rules. We conducted a \ user study comparing QuickDraw with four state-of-the-art \ diagramming tools: Microsoft PowerPoint, Cabri II Plus, Ge- \ ometry Expressions and Geometer�s SketchPad.

It is time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to handle the complicated touch state transitions that result from multiple fingers and their simultaneous movements. In this paper, we present Gesture Coder, which by learning from a few examples given by the developer automatically generates code that recognizes multi-touch gestures, tracks their state changes and invokes corresponding application actions. Developers can easily test the generated code in Gesture Coder, refine it by adding more examples, and once they are satisfied with its performance integrate the code into their applications. We evaluated our learning algorithm exhaustively with various conditions over a large set of noisy data. Our results show that it is sufficient for rapid prototyping and can be improved with higher quality and more training data. We also evaluated Gesture Coder's usability through a within-subject study in which we asked participants to implement a set of multi-touch interactions with and without Gesture Coder. The results show overwhelmingly that Gesture Coder significantly lowers the threshold of programming multi-touch gestures.","1. Android. http://www.android.com. \ 2. Anthony, L. and Wobbrock, J.O.

Miscommunication regarding ""many existing multi-touch applications have this range of gestures"" \  \ P8. We corrected it by explicitly referring to the number of gestures. \  \ 2. Interpretation of the reported recognition rates \  \ P7. We have further discussed the demographics of the participants. \  \ P8. We have further discussed that the reported accuracies underestimated the actual performance of Gesture Coder due to the different setting of the experiment from the real uses of Gesture Coder, the low quality of the data, and the special 12-fold cross-validation. \  \ 3. How the recognition rates can be improved \  \ P8. We have discussed the various ways to improve the recognition rates. \  \ P8. We have tone down the claim by pointing out that the reported accuracies are good enough for fast prototyping, but not so ready for production uses. \  \ WEAK COMPARISON \  \ P9. We toned down the stress on the comparison between Gesture Coder and build-from-scratch condition. Instead, we stated that while we hypothesize that the participants unanimously prefer Gesture Coder, we are more interested in their feedbacks on Gesture Coder in building realistic applications and the common themes that are exposed from the baseline condition. \  \ P8. We further clarified why we did not use exiting toolkits as a baseline condition. \  \ P9. We have shortened the discussion on the study results. \  \ MISSING DETAILS \  \ Fixed the gesture naming. Use the form of a gesture rather than its common semantics, e.g., pinch rather than zoom. \  \ P5. After definition 1, we clarified that in Gesture Coder, finger configuration primarily refers to the number of fingers landed and their landing order, and a motion is the continuous finger movement. \  \ P9. Before discussion section, we point out that for the special case of arbitrary motion, explicit specification of a random motion is more efficient than demonstration. \  \ P4. In the ""Integrating Generated Code into Developers' Project"" Session, we further explained the developer's perspective on the events/callbacks. We also pointed out that they are actually adopted from Apple iOS. \  \ P10. We added tools (8, 11, 15) for other types of gestures to the related work.

Much of this research has been pursued in labs and brief field studies. Comparatively little is known about social agents embedded in the workplace, where employees have repeated interactions with the agent, alone and with others. We designed a social robot snack delivery service for a workplace, and evaluated the service over four months allowing each employee to use it for two months. We report on how employees responded to the robot and the service over repeated encounters. Employees attached different social roles to the robot beyond a delivery person as they incorporated the robot's visit into their workplace routines. Beyond one-on-one interaction, the robot created a ripple effect in the workplace, triggering new behaviors among employees, including politeness, protection of the robot, mimicry, social comparison, and even jealousy. We discuss the implications of these ripple effects for designing services incorporating social agents.","1. Barley, S. R. (1986).

We also explain in the Discussion that the goal was not to mimic real-world systems but to examine levels of a broadly important dimension, and note the resultant opportunity for future work. \ - We have changed the hypotheses to refer to systems that are ""primarily"" for corporate vs. consumer benefit. \  \ 2. Theoretical mechanism \ - We now motivate the hypotheses with references to the workplace-monitoring and personal-informatics literature (p1, col 2) in place of the motivation derived from anecdotal observation. \ - In the discussion, we advance a tentative explanation for the observed results, while noting that future work should examine this explanation more explicitly. \ - We have removed the reference to media-equation theory for the sake of simplicity and focus. \  \ 3. Minor issues \ - We have consolidated Figures 2-4 into a single Figure 2a-c to save space. \ - We have added the Pu et al.

Provides design implications for promoting consensus in distributed discussions of user interface design issues.","Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam","rzilouc2@illinois.edu","Thank you for the detailed and informative reviews. We have addressed all of the concerns of reviewers as best as possible within the ten page limit and the quality of the paper has greatly improved.  This paper was shepherded and two iterations were conducted with the assigned shepherd, who has approved of the final draft. The most significant changes were revising the introduction and related work to clarify the contribution of our work and changing the organization of the paper to better present our qualitative and quantitative results. Below we summarize how we addressed reviewers concerns in the revision.  \  \ [Related Work] Considering all of the reviewer comments in regards to Related Work, we made several substantive changes. First, we revised and renamed the first section now entitled �Consensus and Its Importance for Design Discussions�. This section now offers a concise definition of consensus and it�s relation to UI design discussions. Second, we revised our second section to better situate our work within the prior studies on design discussion in open source software. Third, we replaced the section entitled �Collaboration in Online Communities� with another section called �Studies of Group Decision Making and Consensus�. The new section includes studies that are more closely related to our work. We now do a much better job talking about the outcomes of the prior work and how our work borrows and differs from the prior studies rather than merely mentioning what the prior studies did. The removal of the section �Collaboration in Online Communities� also helps in this regard because it contained many of the offending statements. Finally, all references suggested in the reviews were included in the Related Work or other appropriate parts of the paper. \  \ [Contribution] We revised the Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, and Conclusion to make our contribution clear and to better position our work according to the state of the art in consensus building, group decision making, and studies on distributed design discussions.  \  \ [Organization] We have revised and reorganized Methods and Results to address this issue. First, we revised Methods to first present our methodology in user interviews followed by the methodology utilized in interaction data analysis. Second, we added a section called �User Perspectives on Consensus Building� where we present the majority of the qualitative results including the users� perspectives on benefits of reaching consensus, the challenges of consensus building, and the techniques used to promote consensus. Finally, we placed the explanation of metrics we used for our interaction data analysis and the results of the analysis under a new section called �Interaction Data Analysis�. At the end of this section we used our user interviews to interpret our analysis results. This restructuring should remove the majority of confusions caused by organization of the paper as it has created a stronger connection between the interview results and regression analysis.  \  \ [Metrics] We now have a detailed explanation of the basics of our metrics in our �Interaction Data Analysis� section. As we explained in the paper the metrics were based on the interview results, consensus building literature, and prior research on content analysis. To better present the basis for each metric, we removed the last column of Table 2 and instead we now explain the basis of our metrics in text. The removal of the last column has also made the table more user-friendly.  \  \ We addressed all other smaller issues pointed out by the reviewers in the revision.","","","ContentComplete","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 20:28",""

In so doing, we illustrate the various levels at which agency can emerge in the context of intensive short-time prototyping sessions. In HCI, it is often assumed that the designer is the agent that acts intentionally in the design process. Contrary to this, recent notions of agency provide a way of analysing the performative role of design materials as intra-actions between components within a given phenomenon, rather than as meanings merely ascribed by actions of designers. The notion of agency puts focus on the emerging properties of materials and how they actively contribute to the way that design activity unfolds.  The analyses showed how interaction design is to a large extent driven by emergent characteristics of available materials. The results have implications for understanding material interactions and materiality in interaction design.","1. Barad, K.

Modeled on physical life, it guides designers toward elegant social technologies. However, we argue that it breaks down over modern social network sites because social networks resist its physical metaphors. In this paper, we build theory relating social translucence to social network structure. To explore this idea, we built a tool called Link Different. Link Different addresses a structural awareness problem by letting users know how many of their Twitter followers already a saw link via someone else they follow. During two months on the web, nearly 150K people used the site a total of 1.3M times. Its widespread, viral use suggests that people want social translucence, but network structure gets in the way. We conclude the paper by illustrating new design problems that lie at the intersection of social translucence and other unexplored network structures.","1. D.

Because representation is the only medium that learners can use to make sense of imperceptible phenomena, learners encounter challenges when trying to understand the range of imperceptible sizes. However, the conventional visual representations that are incorporated in many learning technologies tend to direct learners to overestimate the sizes of imperceptible objects. To address this issue, we designed a multimodal representation called “temporal-aural-visual representation (or TAVR) to provide students with an alternative way of perceiving and conceptualizing imperceptible sizes. In prior studies it was noticed that learners constructed more refined mental models of the vast range of imperceptible sizes through the TAVR-enhanced learning activity. In this paper, we introduce a recent study that explored how to best augment the temporal experience of the range of imperceptible sizes with supporting modalities.","1.

A virtual image of a 3D scene is rendered through a half silvered mirror and spatially aligned with the real-world for the viewer. Users easily reach into an interaction volume displaying the virtual image. This allows the user to literally get their hands into the virtual display and to directly interact with an spatially aligned 3D virtual world, without the need for any specialized head-worn hardware or input device. We introduce a new technique for interpreting raw Kinect data to approximate and track rigid (e.g., books, cups) and non-rigid (e.g., hands, paper) physical objects and support a variety of physics-inspired interactions between virtual and real. In particular the algorithm models natural human grasping of virtual objects with more fidelity than previously demonstrated. A qualitative study highlights rich emergent 3D interactions, using hands and real-world objects. The implementation of HoloDesk is described in full, and example application scenarios explored. Finally, HoloDesk is quantitatively evaluated in a 3D target acquisition task, comparing the system with indirect and glasses-based variants.","1. Agrawala, M., et al.

For example, dimensionality reduction methods use various similarity metrics to visualize textual document collections in a spatial metaphor, where similarities between documents are approximately represented through their relative spatial distances to each other in a 2D layout. This metaphor is designed to mimic analysts� mental models of the document collection and support their analytic processes, such as clustering similar documents together. However, in current methods, users must interact with such visualizations using controls external to the visual metaphor, such as sliders, menus, or text fields, to directly control underlying model parameters that they do not understand and that do not relate to their analytic process occurring within the visual metaphor. In this paper, we present the opportunity for a new design space for visual analytic interaction, called semantic interaction, which seeks to enable analysts to spatially interact with such models directly within the visual metaphor using interactions that derive from their analytic process, such as searching, highlighting, annotating, and repositioning documents. Further, we demonstrate how semantic interactions can be implemented using machine learning techniques in a visual analytic tool, called ForceSPIRE, for interactive analysis of textual data within a spatial visualization.  Analysts can express their expert domain knowledge about the documents by simply moving them, which guides the underlying model to improve the overall layout, taking the user�s feedback into account.","1.

However, understanding and validating the output of these models can itself be a challenging analysis task. In this paper, we offer two design considerations--interpretation and trust--for designing visualizations based on data-driven models. Interpretation refers to the facility with which an analyst makes inferences about the data through the lens of a model abstraction. Trust refers to the actual and perceived accuracy of an analyst's inferences. These considerations derive from our experiences developing the Stanford Dissertation Browser, a tool for exploring over 9,000 Ph.D. theses by topical similarity, and a subsequent review of existing literature. We contribute a novel similarity measure for text collections based on a notion of ""word-borrowing"" that arose from an iterative design process. Based on our experiences and a literature review, we distill a set of design recommendations and describe how they promote interpretable and trustworthy visual analysis tools.","1.

For low-income children in developing countries, this task can be significantly more challenging because of lack of access to high-quality schooling, but can potentially improve economic prospects at the same time. A synthesis of research findings suggests that practicing recalling and vocalizing words for expressing an intended meaning could improve word reading skills – including reading in a second language – more than silent recognition of what the given words mean. Unfortunately, many language learning software do not support this instructional approach, owing to the technical challenges of incorporating speech recognition support to check that the learner is vocalizing the correct word. In this paper, we present results from a usability test and two subsequent experiments that explore the use of two speech recognition-enabled mobile games to help rural children in India read words with understanding. Through a working speech recognition prototype, we discuss two major contributions of this work: first, we give empirical evidence that shows the extent to which productive training (i.e. vocalizing words) is superior to receptive vocabulary training, and discuss the use of scaffolding hints to “unpack” factors in the learner’s linguistic knowledge that may impact reading. Second, we discuss what our results suggest for future research in HCI.","1. Agarwal, S., Jain, A., Kumar, A., Rajput, N. The World Wide Telecom Web Browser. In Proc. ACM DEV 2010. \ 2.

Instead of the prevailing approach of pasting ``information bubbles'' onto the existing urban scenery, ClayVision communicates through real-time 3D transformations of city elements. In other words, the system dynamically probes and reassembles the city into a better-designed copy of the original, that is both easier to navigate and tailored to suit the user's needs and preferences.

A cadaster is an official register that records land properties (e.g., location, ownership, value and size) for land valuation and taxation. Such mapping of old and new cadasters can help historians understand the social/economic background of changes in land uses or ownership. With JigsawMap, historians can continue mapping older or newer cadasters. In this way, JigsawMap can connect the past land survey results to today and to the future. We conducted usability studies and long term case studies to evaluate JigsawMap, and received positive responses. As well as summarizing the evaluation results, we also present design guidelines for participatory design projects with historians. ","1.

In this paper, we present three cases in which ED clinicians designed workarounds in order to adapt to the new work practice. Our findings reveal a rich picture of ED clinicians� active reinterpretation and modification of their work practice through their engagement with the system-in-use and its organizational and physical context. These findings call for the adaptation period in designing a socio-technical system in healthcare settings to be critically considered as an active end-user design process, a negotiating process, and a re-routinized process.

For user problems that were covered by WCAG 2.0, 16.7% of websites implemented techniques recommended in WCAG 2.0 but the techniques did not solve the problems.  These results show that few developers are implementing the current version of WCAG, and even when the guidelines are implemented on websites there is little indication that people with disabilities will encounter fewer problems.  The paper closes by discussing the implications of this study for future research and practice. In particular, it discusses the need to move away from a problem-based approach towards a design principle approach for web accessibility.","1. Research Based Web Design & Usability Guidelines.

Such devices always stay with the user, making their implanted user interfaces available at all times. We discuss four core challenges of implanted user interfaces: how to sense input through the skin, how to produce output, how to communicate amongst one another and with external infrastructure, and how to remain powered. We investigate these four challenges in a technical evaluation where we surgically implant study devices into a specimen arm. We find that traditional interfaces do work through skin. We then demonstrate how to deploy a prototype device on participants, using artificial skin to simulate implantation. We close with a discussion of medical considerations of implanted user interfaces, risks and limitations, and project into the future. \ ","1.	Anderson, S.D.

Shyam Sundar","sss12@psu.edu","A paradigmatic quality of interactive interfaces is that they allow users to express themselves, thereby converting message receivers into communication sources. We define this quality as Source Interactivity [26, 29], and test its effects on user experience with a field experiment (N=141) of a portal site featuring cosmetic customization, functional customization and blogging (active versus filter). In demonstrating the psychological influence of source-based interactivity on such outcomes as user engagement, sense of agency, sense of community, intrinsic motivation and attitudes toward the interface, we discuss how designers can use them for creating interactive tools for self-expression.

The introduction and discussion sections were entirely rewritten and sent to the AC on January 5, who expressed approval but suggested further changes, which we found useful and therefore implemented them. This round of feedback was helpful in confirming that we were on the right track, allowing us to fine-tune our framing and discussion points to better address all the issues raised by reviewers throughout the process. \ 2.	We have removed �source interactivity� from the title, as suggested, and explicated the concept earlier in the draft, providing both theoretical and operational definitions. We have clarified the connection between source interactivity and our key manipulations in the study with the help of the source-interactivity continuum. \ 3.	Revised the introduction to bring out the motivations underlying the study, especially in terms of how source interactivity fits into UI design goals for customizable interfaces. \ 4.	We have included a central theoretical models�interactivity effects model and agency model of customization--that serve as frameworks to integrate some of the earlier findings we review and also guide hypotheses and predictions in the current paper. \ 5.	Modified the title of the paper to shed attention to one of the main concepts in the paper, i.e., self-expression brought out by the use of source interactivity affordances. \ 6.	Spelled out the practical questions and considerations that drive the study�s hypotheses. \ 7.	While reviewing prior studies on the topic, we have distinguished how our study differs from and broadens the scope of earlier findings. \ 8.	We have strengthened the discussion of results by tying it to theoretical arguments (e.g., agency model of customization, sleeper effect, decision-fatigue).  \ 9.	In our summary and discussion, we have laid out specific design goals that are supported from the findings in our paper. We have tried to associate these practical design goals with specific theories discussed earlier in the paper. \ 10.	We have included demographic data in the method section, as suggested by one of the reviewers (R3). \ 11.	We have included effect size calculations and revised graphs as per R1 and R3�s suggestion in the results section. We have incorporated the effect size influence in our discussion section based on the most recent reactions from the AC. \ 12.	We have revised the design implication headers in the discussion section, as suggested by the AC in the most recent reaction to our edits. \ ","","user experience","","FormatComplete","","","Sep 23 22:50",""
